[Verse 1: 2Pac] I see no changes, wake up in the morning and I ask myself: "Is life worth living? Should I blast myself?" I'm tired of being poor and, even worse, I'm black My stomach hurts so I'm looking for a purse to snatch Cops give a damn about a negro Pull the trigger, kill a nigga, he's a hero "Give the crack to the kids: who the hell cares? One less hungry mouth on the welfare!" First ship 'em dope and let 'em deal to brothers Give 'em guns, step back, watch 'em kill each other "It's time to fight back," that's what Huey said Two shots in the dark, now Huey's dead I got love for my brother But we can never go nowhere unless we share with each other We gotta start making changes Learn to see me as a brother instead of two distant strangers And that's how it's supposed to be How can the Devil take a brother if he's close to me? I'd love to go back to when we played as kids But things change... and that's the way it is Talent That's just the way it is Things'll never be the same That's just the way it is Aww yeah That's just the way it is Things'll never be the same That's just the way it is Aww yeah [Verse 2: 2Pac] I see no changes, all I see is racist faces Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races We under, I wonder what it takes to make this One better place, let's erase the wasted Take the evil out the people, they'll be acting right Cause both Black and White are smoking crack tonight And the only time we chill is when we kill each other It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other And although it seems heaven-sent We ain't ready to see a black president It ain't a secret, don't conceal the fact: The penitentiary's packed, and it's filled with blacks But some things will never change Try to show another way, but you staying in the dope game Now tell me, what's a mother to do? Being real don't appeal to the brother in you You gotta operate the easy way "I made a G today," but you made it in a sleazy way Selling crack to the kids "I gotta get paid!", well hey, but that's the way it is That's just the way it is Things'll never be the same That's just the way it is Aww yeah That's just the way it is Things'll never be the same That's just the way it is Aww yeah [2Pac Talking] We gotta make a change It's time for us as a people to start making some changes Let's change the way we eat, let's change the way we live And let's change the way we treat each other You see the old way wasn't working So it's on us to do what we gotta do to survive And still I see no changes Can't a brother get a little peace? It's war on the streets and a war in the Middle East Instead of war on poverty They got a war on drugs so the police can bother me And I ain't never did a crime I ain't have to do But now I'm back with the facts giving it back to you Don't let 'em jack you up, back you up Crack you up and pimp-smack you up You gotta learn to hold your own They get jealous when they see you with your mobile phone But tell the cops they can't touch this I don't trust this, when they try to rush I bust this That's the sound of my tool You say it ain't cool, my mama didn't raise no fool And as long as I stay black, I gotta stay strapped And I never get to lay back Cause I always got to worry 'bout the payback Some buck that I roughed up way back Coming back after all these years "Rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat!" That's the way it is That's just the way it is Things'll never be the same That's just the way it is Aww yeah That's just the way it is Things'll never be the same That's just the way it is Aww yeah Some things'll never change 
When I was young, me and my mama had beef 17 years old, kicked out on the streets Though back at the time I never thought I'd see her face Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place Suspended from school And scared to go home, I was a fool With the big boys breaking all the rules I shed tears with my baby sister, over the years We was poorer than the other little kids And even though we had different daddies, the same drama When things went wrong we'd blame Mama I reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell Huggin' on my mama from a jail cell And who'd think in elementary, hey I'd see the penitentiary one day? And running from the police, that's right Mama catch me, put a whoopin' to my backside And even as a crack fiend, Mama You always was a black queen, Mama I finally understand For a woman it ain't easy trying to raise a man You always was committed A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how you did it There's no way I can pay you back, but the plan Is to show you that I understand; you are appreciated [Hook Reggie Green & "Sweet Franklin" + 2Pac] Lady, don't you know we love ya?

Now, ain't nobody tell us it was fair No love from my daddy, cause the coward wasn't there He passed away and I didn't cry, cause my anger Wouldn't let me feel for a stranger They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless, but all along I was looking for a father he was gone I hung around with the thugs And even though they sold drugs They showed a young brother love I moved out and started really hangin' I needed money of my own, so I started slangin' I ain't guilty, cause even though I sell rocks It feels good putting money in your mailbox I love paying rent when the rent is due I hope you got the diamond necklace that I sent to you Cause when I was low you was there for me And never left me alone, because you cared for me And I could see you coming home after work late You're in the kitchen, trying to fix us a hot plate You just working with the scraps you was given And Mama made miracles every Thanksgivin' But now the road got rough, you're alone You're trying to raise two bad kids on your own And there's no way I can pay you back, but my plan Is to show you that I understand; you are appreciated [Hook Reggie Green & "Sweet Franklin" + 2Pac] Lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama) Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated) Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya? Pour out some liquor and I reminisce And even though I act crazy I gotta thank the Lord that you made me You never kept a secret, always stayed real And I appreciate how you raised me And all the extra love that you gave me I wish I could take the pain away If you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day Everything will be alright if you hold on It's a struggle every day, gotta roll on And there's no way I can pay you back, but my plan Is to show you that I understand; you are appreciated [Hook Reggie Green & "Sweet Franklin" + 2Pac] Lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama) Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated) Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya?

Little something for my godson Elijah And a little girl named Corin [Verse 1] Some say the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice I say the darker the flesh then the deeper the roots I give a holla to my sisters on welfare 2Pac cares if don't nobody else care And I know they like to beat you down a lot When you come around the block, brothers clown a lot But please don't cry, dry your eyes, never let up Forgive, but don't forget, girl, keep your head up And when he tells you you ain't nothing, don't believe him And if he can't learn to love you, you should leave him Cause, sister, you don't need him And I ain't trying to gas ya up, I just call 'em how I see 'em You know what makes me unhappy? When brothers make babies and leave a young mother to be a pappy And since we all came from a woman Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman I wonder why we take from our women Why we rape our women, do we hate our women? I think it's time to kill for our women Time to heal our women, be real to our women And if we don't we'll have a race of babies That will hate the ladies that make the babies And since a man can't make one He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one So will the real men get up? I know you're fed up, ladies, but keep your head up [Hook] Keep ya head up, ooh, child Things are gonna get easier Keep ya head up, ooh, child Things'll get brighter Keep ya head up, ooh, child Things are gonna get easier Keep ya head up, ooh, child Things'll get brighter Ayo, I remember Marvin Gaye used to sing to me He had me feeling like black was the thing to be And suddenly the ghetto didn't seem so tough And though we had it rough, we always had enough I huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules Ran with the local crew and had a smoke or two And I realize Momma really paid the price She nearly gave her life to raise me right And all I had to give her was my pipe dream Of how I'd rock the mic and make it to the bright screen I'm trying to make a dollar out of fifteen cents It's hard to be legit and still pay the rent And in the end it seems I'm heading for the pen I try to find my friends, but they're blowing in the wind Last night my buddy lost his whole family It's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity It seems the rain'll never let up I try to keep my head up and still keep from getting wet up You know, it's funny, when it rains it pours They got money for wars but can't feed the poor Say there ain't no hope for the youth And the truth is it ain't no hope for the future And then they wonder why we crazy I blame my mother for turning my brother into a crack baby We ain't meant to survive cause it's a set-up And even though you're fed up Huh, you got to keep your head up [Hook] Keep ya head up, ooh, child Things are gonna get easier Keep ya head up, ooh, child Things'll get brighter Keep ya head up, ooh, child Things are gonna get easier Keep ya head up, ooh, child Things'll get brighter And uh, to all the ladies having babies on they own I know it's kinda rough and you're feeling all alone Daddy's long gone and he left you by your lonesome Thank the Lord for my kids even if nobody else want 'em Cause I think we can make it, in fact, I'm sure And if you fall, stand tall and come back for more Cause ain't nothing worse than when your son Wants to know why his daddy don't love him no mo' You can't complain you was dealt this Hell of a hand without a man, feeling helpless Because there's too many things for you to deal with Dying inside, but outside you're looking fearless While tears is rolling down your cheeks You steady hoping things don't fall down this week Cause if it did, you couldn't take it And don't blame me, I was given this world, I didn't make it And now my son's getting older and older and colder From having the world on his shoulders While the rich kids is driving Benz I'm still trying to hold on to surviving friends And it's crazy, it seems it'll never let up But please, you got to keep your head up

He hang with girls like he Lena, but needed some time to re-up Tequila in the cantina, 30 dollars I swallowed The Sauza so malo then she said "You need to grow up You been doing this for too long That Camp was a million years ago, sing me a different song" Whether you're trolling or controlling, just a reminder You think you get it, you don't, it's that Andrew Auernheimer I'm gone Now I'm back Give a fuck or give 'em hell, just not a chance to react Tyler Durden this burden, hurting, they said there was curtains Certain demise, look in his eyes, the pain inadvertent I could've stayed where I was and have a life you'd be proud of But I'd rather chase things never thought of It was all love, saying "Go hard" Making dope, it's a trap, Ackbar backfired Panic dreams, so it seems we're meant to die I had to figure it out; "It's the best," no, that's a lie Had to get some stuff off my chest, I vaporized High on my own, it took time to realize Because the Internet, mistakes are forever But if we fuck up on this journey, at least we're together Man, I wish I could go back and tell that kid it's make-believe Make 'em believe in themselves, people who needed my help Feelings I felt, keeling myself No one's ever been this lost I just get the information retweet it or say it sucks I just got the motivation, your talent's just a bunch of luck Hard work and dedication, but lately it's run amok Waking up in these places I don't remember Texts from people I never met, doors left open (Who is this?

Uh, yeah I'm killin' you, step inside the lion's den Man I'm hov if the 'O' was an 'I' instead On stage with my family in front of me I am what I am: everything I wanna be [Outro] This is on a bus back from camp. Im thirteen and so are you. Before I left for camp I imagined it would be me and three or four other dudes I hadnt met yet, running around all summer, getting into trouble. It turned out it would be me and just one girl. Thats you. And were still at camp as long as were on the bus and not at the pickup point where our parents would be waiting for us. Were still wearing our orange camp t-shirts. We still smell like pineneedles. I like you and you like me and I more-than-like you, but I dont know if you do or dont more-than-like me. Youve never said, so I havent been saying anything all summer, content to enjoy the small miracle of a girl choosing to talk to me and choosing to do so again the next day and so on. A girl whos smart and funny and who, if I say something dumb for a laugh, is willing to say something two or three times as dumb to make me laugh, but who also gets weird and wise sometimes in a way I could never be. A girl who reads books that no ones assigned to her, whose curly brown hair has a line running through it from where she put a tie to hold it up while it was still wet Back in the real world we dont go to the same school, and unless one of our families moves to a dramatically different neighborhood, we wont go to the same high school. So, this is kind of it for us. Unless I say something. And it might especially be it for us if I actually do say something. The suns gone down and the bus is quiet. A lot of kids are asleep. Were talking in whispers about a tree we saw at a rest stop that looks like a kid we know. And then Im like, Can I tell you something? And all of a sudden Im telling you. And I keep telling you and it all comes out of me and it keeps coming and your face is there and gone and there and gone as we pass underneath the orange lamps that line the sides of the highway. And theres no expression on it. And I think just after a point Im just talking to lengthen the time where we live in a world where you havent said yes or no yet. And regrettably I end up using the word destiny. I dont remember in what context. Doesnt really matter. Before long Im out of stuff to say and you smile and say, okay. I dont know exactly what you mean by it, but it seems vaguely positive and I would leave in order not to spoil the moment, but theres nowhere to go because were are on a bus. So I pretend like Im asleep and before long, I really am I wake up, the bus isnt moving anymore. The domed lights that line the center aisle are all on. I turn and youre not there. Then again a lot of kids arent in their seats anymore. Were parked at the pick-up point, which is in the parking lot of a Methodist church. The bus is half empty. You might be in your dads car by now, your bags and things piled high in the trunk. The girls in the back of the bus are shrieking and laughing and taking their sweet time disembarking as I swing my legs out into the aisle to get up off the bus, just as one of them reaches my row. It used to be our row, on our way off. Its Michelle, a girl who got suspended from third grade for a week after throwing rocks at my head. Adolescence is doing her a ton of favors body-wise. She stops and looks down at me. And her head is blasted from behind by the dome light, so I cant really see her face, but I can see her smile. And she says one word: destiny. Then her and the girls clogging the aisles behind her all laugh and then she turns and leads them off the bus. I didnt know you were friends with them I find my dad in the parking lot. He drives me back to our house and camp is over. So is summer, even though theres two weeks until school starts. This isnt a story about how girls are evil or how love is bad, this is a story about how I learned something and Im not saying this thing is true or not, Im just saying its what I learned. I told you something. It was just for you and you told everybody. So I learned cut out the middle man, make it all for everybody, always. Everybody cant turn around and tell everybody, everybody already knows, I told them. But this means there isnt a place in my life for you or someone like you. Is it sad? Sure. But its a sadness I chose. I wish I could say this was a story about how I got on the bus a boy and got off a man more cynical, hardened, and mature and shit. But thats not true. The truth is I got on the bus a boy. And I never got off the bus. I still havent...

Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz Girl I felt like we had it all planned out, I guess I fucked up the vision Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions When you find out how I'm living, I just hope I'm forgiven It seem like you don't want this love anymore I'm acting out in the open, it's hard for you to ignore But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?

Hopefully something a bit relevant as to us all are having the same fears, shedding similar tears, and of course dying in so many years. It don't mean that we can't have a good life. So we'd like to just maybe close out with something, some food for thought, for all of us

[Verse 1] Came to the world at a time when it was in need of a villain An asshole, that role think I succeeded fulfilling But don't think I ever stopped to think that I was speaking to children Everything was happening so fast, it was like I blinked sold three million Then it all went blank, all I remember is feelin' ridiculous cause I was getting sick of this feelin' Like I am always under attack, man, I could have stacked my shit list to the ceiling Women dishin' but really thinking if anyone ever talks to one of my little girls like this I would kill him Guess I'm a little bit of a hypocrite when I'm rippin' shit But since when did this many People ever give a shit what I had to say, it's just my opinion If it contradicts how I'm living, put a dick in your rear end That's why every time you mentioned a lyric, I thanked you for it For drawing more attention toward it Cause it gave me an enormous platform, I'm flattered you thought I was that important But you can't ignore the fact that I fought for the respect and battle for it Mad awards, had GLAAD annoyed atta-boy They told me to slow down, and I just zone out Good luck trying to convince a blonde, it's like telling Gwen Stefani that she sold out Cause I was trying to leave, No Doubt In anyone's mind one day I'd go down in history think they know now Because everybody knows [Hook: Skylar Grey] Everybody knows that you're just an asshole Everywhere that you go, people wanna go home, everyone knows Everybody knows, so don't pretend to be nice There's no place you can hide You are just an asshole Everyone knows, everyone knows [Bridge] Thanks for the support, asshole *scratch* Thanks for the support, asshole Quit actin' salty I was countin' on you to count me out Ask Asher Roth when he round about dissed me to shout me out Thought I was history But goddamn honky That compliment's like backhanding a donkey Good way to get your ass socked in the mouth Nah, I'm off him But what the fuck is all this trash talkin' about The fight was fixed I'm back and you can't stop me You knocked me down, I went down for the count I fell but the fans caught me and now You're gonna have to beat the fuckin' pants off me to take my belt Word to Pacquiao Momma said there ain't nothing else to talk about Better go in that ring and knock 'em out Or you better not come out It's poetry in motion Like Freddie Roach when he's quotin' SHAKESpeare So what if the insults are revolting Even Helen Keller knows life stinks You think it's a joke 'til you're bullet riddled But you should give little shit what I think This whole world is a mess Gotta have a goddamn vest on your chest and a Glock just to go watch Batman Who needs to test a testicles Not that man Half of you don't got the guts and intestinal blockage Rest of you got lap bands Stuck to this motto before they put bath salts and all those water bottles in Colorado So get lost, Waldo My soul's escaping through this asshole that is gaping A black hole and I'm swallowing this track whole Better pack toilet paper But I'm taking no crap, ho Here I go down the Bat Pole And I'm changing back into that old maniac in fact there they go Trying to dip out the back door retreating Cause everybody knows [Hook: Skylar Grey] Everybody knows that you're just an asshole Everywhere that you go, people wanna go home, everyone knows Everybody knows, so don't pretend to be nice There's no place you can hide You are just an asshole Everyone knows, everyone knows Holy mackerel I'm the biggest jerk on the planet Earth I smacked a girl off the mechanical bull at a tractor pull For thinking we had some magnetic pull Then screamed "ICP in this bitch! How do fucking magnets work?" Cause you're attractive, but we ain't attractable Hate to be dramatical, but I'm not romantical I'm making up words you can understandable It's tragical Thinkin' some magical shit's gonna happen That ain't practical You cracking a joke, it's laughable Cause me and love's like a bad combination I keep them feelings locked in a vault so it's safe to say I'm uncrackable My heart is truly guarded Full body armor Bitch, you just need a helmet cause if you think you're special, you're retarded Thinking you're one of a kind Like you got some platinum vagina You're a train wreck, I got a one-track mind Shorty, you're fine but you sort of remind me of a 49er Cause you been a gold digger since you was a miner Been tryna hunt me down like a dog Cause you're on my ass but you can't get a scent Cause all of my spare time is spent On my nose in this binder, so don't bother tryin' Only women that I love are my daughters, but sometimes I rhyme And it sounds like I forget I'm a father, and I push it farther, so Father forgive me if I forget to draw the line It's apparent I shouldn't have been a parent, I'll never grow up, so to hell with your parents And 'mother' fucking 'father' time It ain't never gonna stop, a pessimist who transformed to an optimist in his prime So even if I'm half dead, I'm half alive Poured my half empty glass in a cup, so now my cup has runneth over And I'm bout to set it on you like a muthafucking coaster Im going back to what got me here, yeah cocky And cant knock being rude off, so fear not my dear And dry up your teardrops I'm here White America's mirror, so don't feel awkward or weird If you stare at me and see yourself, because you're one too Shouldn't be a shock, because everybody knows 
[Part 1: Produced by S1 and M-Phazes] [Verse 1] It's like I'm in this dirt, digging up old hurt Tried everything to get my mind off you, it won't work All it takes is one song on the radio You're right back on it reminding me all over again How you fucking just brushed me off and left me so burnt Spent a lot of time trying to soul search Maybe I needed to grow up a little first Well, looks like I hit a growth spurt But I'm coming for closure Don't suppose an explanation I'm owed For the way that you turned your back on me Just when I may have needed you most Oh, you thought it was over? You could just close the Chapter and go about your life, like it was nothing You ruined mine, but you seem to be doing fine Well, I've never recovered, but tonight I bet ya that what You're 'bout to go through's tougher than anything I ever have suffered Can't think of a better way to define poetic justice Can I hold grudges, mind saying, "Let it go, fuck this" Heart's saying: "I will, once I bury this bitch alive Hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset" [Hook: Sarah Jaffe] I flee the scene like it was my last ride You see right through, oh you had me pegged the first time You can see the truth but it's easier to justify What's bad is good And I hate to be the bad guy I just hate to be the bad guy (Follow me I ruh-uh-un, follow me I ruh-uh-un) I just hate to be the bad guy (Follow me I ruh-uh-un, follow me I ruh-uh-un) [Verse 2] And to think, I used to think you was the shit, bitch To think it was you at one time I worshipped, shit Think you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it Not this time, you better go and get the sewing kit, bitch Finish this stitch so you can reap what you sew, nitwit Thought some time would pass and I'd forget it? Forget it You left our family in shambles And you expect me to just get over him, pretend he never existed? May be gone, but he's not forgotten And don't think cause he's been out the pictures So long that I've stopped the plotting and still ain't coming to getcha You're wrong and that shit was rotten And the way you played him, same shit you did to me; cold Have you any idea the shit that I've gone through? Feelings I harbor, all this pent up resentment I hold on to Not once you call to ask me how I'm doing Letters, you don't respond to 'em Fuck it, I'm coming to see you And gee who better to talk to than you, the cause of my problems My life is garbage and I'm 'bout to take it out on you Poof, then I'm gone, voosh And... [Hook: Sarah Jaffe] I flee the scene like it was my last ride You see right through, oh you had me pegged the first time You can see the truth but it's easier to justify What's bad is good And I hate to be the bad guy I just hate to be the bad guy (Follow me I ruh-uh-un, follow me I ruh-uh-un) I just hate to be the bad guy (Follow me I ruh-uh-un, follow me I ruh-uh-un) [Verse 3] I've been driving around your side of this town Like nine frickin' hours and forty-five minutes now Finally I found your new address, park in your drive Feel like I've been waiting on this moment all of my life And it's now arrived, and my mouth is full of saliva My knife is out and I'm ducking on the side of your house See, it's sad it came to this point Such a disappointment I had to make this appointment to come and see ya But I ain't here for your empathy I don't need your apology, or your friendship or sympathy It's revenge that I seek So I sneak vengefully and treat your bedroom window Like I reach my full potential, I peeked Continue to peep, still bent low, then keep Tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo, sneak All the way 'round to the back porch, man Door handles unlocked Shouldn't be that easy to do this You don't plan for intruders beforehand Surprised to see me? Cat got your tongue? Gag, chloroform rag Gag, almost hack-up a lung like you picked an axe up and swung, Stick to the core plan Dragged to the back of a trunk by one of your fans Irony's spectacular, huh? Now who's a faggot, you punk And here's your Bronco hat; you can have that shit back cause they suck It's just me, you and the music now, Slim, I hope you hear it We're in a car right now, wait, here comes my favorite lyric "I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die" And hey, here's a sequel to my Mathers LP just to try to get people to buy How's this for a publicity stunt, this should be fun Last album now, cause after this you'll be officially done Eminem killed by M and M, Matthew Mitchell Bitch, I even have your initials I initially was gonna bury you next to my brother but fuck it Since you're in love with your city so much I figured, what the fuck the best place you could be buried alive is right here Two more exits, time is quite near Hope we don't get stopped, no license I fear That sirens I hear Guess 90 on the freeway wasn't the brightest idea As cops appear in my driver's side mirror (Oh, God, police aaaghh) Hope Foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot, at least New plan Stan, Slim "chauvinist pig drove in this big Lincoln Town Car" Well gotta go, almost at the bridge Ha ha big bro it's for you, Slim, this is for him And Frank Ocean; oh, hope you can swim good Now say you hate homos again [Part 2: Produced by StreetRunner] [Verse 4] I also represent anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend I'm the nightmare you fell asleep and then woke up still in I'm your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen Perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin Nope, it's hopeless, I'm the denial that you're hopelessly in When they say all of this is approaching its end But you refuse to believe that it's over Here we go all over again Back's to the wall, I'm stacking up all them odds Toilets clogged, yeah cause I'm talking a lot of shit but I'm backing it all up But in my head there's a voice in the back and it hollers after the track is demolished "I am your lack of a conscience" I'm the ringing in your ears I'm the polyps on the back of your tonsils Eatin' your vocal chords after your concerts I'm your time that's almost up that you haven't acknowledged Grab for some water but I'm that pill that's too jagged to swallow I'm the bullies you hate That you became with every faggot you slaughtered Coming back on you, every woman you insult, batter but the double-standards you have when it comes to your daughters I represent everything, you take for granted Cause Marshall Mathers the rapper's persona's half a facade And Matthew and Stan's just symbolic Of you not knowing what you had 'til it's gone Cause after all the glitz and the glam No more fans that are calling your name Cameras are off Sad, but it happens to all of 'em I'm the hindsight to say, I told you so Foreshadows of all the, things that are to follow I'm the future that's here to show you what happens tomorrow If you don't stop after they call ya Biggest laughing stock of rap who can't call it quits When it's time to walk away, I'm every guilt trip The baggage you have but, as you gather up all your possessions If there's anything you have left to say 'Less it makes an impact, then don't bother So 'fore you rest your case Better make sure you're packing a wallop So one last time I'm back, before it fades into black and it's all over Behold the, final chapter in a saga Trying to recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle Twice, the magic that started It all, tragic portrait of an artist tortured trapped in his own drawings Tap into thoughts blacker and darker Than anything imaginable, here goes a wild stab in the dark, uh As we (I) pick up where the last Mathers left off 
Lately I've been hard to reach I've been too long on my own Everybody has a private world Where they can be alone Are you calling me? Are you trying to get through? Are you reaching out for me And I'm reaching out for you I'm just so fucking depressed I just can't seem to get out this slump If I could just get over this hump But I need something to pull me out this dump I took my bruises, took my lumps Fell down and I got right back up But I need that spark to get psyched back up In order for me to pick the mic back up I don't know how or why or when I ended up in this position I'm in I'm starting to feel distant again So I decided just to pick this pen Up and try to make an attempt to vent But I just can't admit or come to grips With the fact that I may be done with rap I need a new outlet And I know some shit's so hard to swallow But I just can't sit back and wallow In my own sorrow, but I know one fact: I'll be one tough act to follow One tough act to follow I'll be one tough act to follow Here today, gone tomorrow But you'd have to walk a thousand miles In my shoes, just to see what it's like to be me I'll be you, let's trade shoes Just to see what it'd be like to Feel your pain, you feel mine Go inside each other's minds Just to see what we find Look at shit through each other's eyes But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful They can all get fucked, just stay true to you Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful They can all get fucked, just stay true to you I think I'm starting to lose my sense of humor Everything's so tense and gloom I almost feel like I gotta check the temperature Of the room, just as soon as I walk in, it's like all eyes on me So I try to avoid any eye contact Cause if I do that, then it opens a door For conversation, like I want that I'm not looking for extra attention I just wanna be just like you Blend in with the rest of the room Maybe just point me to the closest restroom I don't need no fuckin' man-servant Tryna follow me around and wipe my ass Laugh at every single joke I crack And half of 'em ain't even funny, like, "Ha! Marshall, you're so funny man You should be a comedian, goddamn!" Unfortunately I am I just hide behind the tears of a clown So why don't you all sit down? Listen to the tale I'm about to tell Hell, we don't gotta trade our shoes And you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles In my shoes, just to see what it's like to be me I'll be you, let's trade shoes Just to see what it'd be like to Feel your pain, you feel mine Go inside each other's minds Just to see what we find Look at shit through each other's eyes But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful They can all get fucked, just stay true to you Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful They can all get fucked, just stay true to you [Verse 3] Nobody asked for life to deal us With these bullshit hands we're dealt We gotta take these cards ourselves And flip 'em, don't expect no help Now, I could've either just sat on my ass And pissed and moaned Or take this situation in which I'm placed in And get up and get my own I was never the type of kid To wait by the door and pack his bags And sat on the porch and hoped and prayed For a dad to show up who never did I just wanted to fit in in every single place Every school I went I dreamed of being that cool kid Even if it meant acting stupid Aunt Edna always told me "Keep making that face it'll get stuck like that" Meanwhile, I'm just standing there Holding my tongue trying to talk *like this* 'Til I stuck my tongue On that frozen stop sign pole at 8 years old I learned my lesson then Cause I wasn't trying to impress my friends no mo' But I already told you my whole life story Not just based on my description Cause where you see it from where you're sittin' Is probably 110% different I guess we would have to walk a mile In each other's shoes at least What size you wear? I wear 10's Let's see if you can fit your feet In my shoes, just to see what it's like to be me I'll be you, let's trade shoes Just to see what it'd be like to Feel your pain, you feel mine Go inside each other's minds Just to see what we find Look at shit through each other's eyes But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful They can all get fucked, just stay true to you Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful They can all get fucked, just stay true to you Lately I've been hard to reach I've been too long on my own Everybody has a private world Where they can be alone Are you calling me? Are you trying to get through? Are you reaching out for me And I'm reaching out for you To my babies: stay strong Daddy'll be home soon And to the rest of the world God gave you them shoes that fit you So put 'em on and wear 'em Be yourself, man, be proud of who you are Even if it sounds corny Never let no one tell you you ain't beautiful 
[Intro] I can feel the heat rising, everything is on fire Today is a painful reminder of why We can only get brighter The further you put it behind ya But right now I'm on the inside (Lookin' out, cause) [Hook: Sia] I'm standin' in the flames Its a beautiful kind of pain Settin' fire to yesterday Find the light, find the light, find the light [Verse 1] Yesterday was the tornado warning Today's like the morning after Your world is torn in half You wake in its wake to start the mourning process And rebuilding, you're still a work in progress Today's a whole new chapter It's like an enormous asth-ma Thunderstorm has passed ya You weathered it and poked its eye out With the thorn bush that you Used to smell the roses Stopped to inhale, can't even tell your nose is, stuffed So focused on the bright side Then you floor the gas pedal And hit the corner fast the more asserted Never looking back May hit the curb But every day is a new learning curve as you Steer through life, sometimes you might not wanna swerve But you have to To avert a disaster Lucky no permanent damage Cause they hurt you so bad It's like they murdered your ass And threw dirt on your casket but you've returned from the ashes And that hurt that you have, you just converted to gasoline And while you're burning the past, standing in the inferno and chant [Hook: Sia] I'm standin' in the flames Its a beautiful kind of pain Settin' fire to yesterday Find the light, find the light, find the light [Verse 2] You're so familiarized with what having to swallow this pill is like It happens all the time, they take your heart and steal your life And it's as though you feel you've died Cause you've been killed inside But yet you're still alive Which means you will survive Although today you may weep cause you're weakened And everything seems so bleak and hopeless The light that you're seekin' It begins to seep in That's the only thing keepin' You from leapin' off the mothafreakin' deep end And I'm pullin' for you to push through this feeling And with a little time that should do the healing And by tomorrow You may even feel so good that you're willing to forgive 'em even after All the shit you been put through this feeling of resilience is building And the flames are burning quick as fire would through this building You're sealed in but you're fireproof, flame retardant, you withstood it And as you climb up to the roof, you're just chillin' you look down Cause you're so over 'em You could put the heel of your foot through the ceiling [Bridge] As time passes Things change every day But wounds, wounds heal, but scars still remain the same But tomorrow today's going down in flames Throw the match, set the past ablaze [Verse 3] So feel the fire beneath your feet as you barely even perspire From the heat Exhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief And as you say goodbye to the grief It's like watching the walls melt in your prison cell But you've extinguished this living hell Still a little piece of you dies as you scream [Hook: Sia] I'm standin' in the flames Its a beautiful kind of pain Settin' fire to yesterday Find the light, find the light, find the light I feel the burn, watch the smoke as I turn Rising, a phoenix from the flames I have learned, from fighting fights, that weren't mine Not with fists, but with wings that I will fly [Hook: Sia] I'm standin' in the flames Its a beautiful kind of pain Settin' fire to yesterday Find the light, find the light, find the light

I have; I've been protested and demonstrated against Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times Sick as the mind of the motherfuckin' kid that's behind All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans Explodin', tempers flaring from parents Just blow 'em off and keep goin' Not taking nothing from no one Give 'em hell long as I'm breathin' Keep kicking ass in the morning And taking names in the evenin' Leave 'em with the taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth See, they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out Look at me now! I bet you're probably sick of me now Ain't you, Momma?

Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, ma? So you could try to justify the way you treated me, ma? But guess what, you're getting older now And it's cold when you're lonely And Nathan's growing up so quick He's gonna know that you're phony And Hailie's getting so big now You should see her, she's beautiful But you'll never see her she won't even be at your funeral See, what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong, bitch, do your song Keep telling yourself that you was a mom! But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get? You selfish bitch; I hope you fucking burn in hell for this shit Remember when Ronnie died And you said you wished it was me? Well, guess what, I am dead dead to you as can be!

I still never ABC'd the shit Mainstream appeal, but the skill is what made me iller Since before they called Jay Dee Dilla I was daydreamin' one day I would be the shit And if I ever end up escapin' these streets I swear that I would stay here still And if I'm crazy, I'll always be real Don't make me steal an eighteen-wheeler Break all of my friends out of here And take 'em straight to the Mercedes dealer Peel off back to the same block that we came from On a rampage too crazy for me to flip What's makin' you think I need a switch?

But ain't we sick of bein' underdogs? Don't make me unleash this shit, release this pit May even seem as if I'm yankin' your chain a bit Or maybe the way in which I'm sayin' shit Is playin' with you, but ain't shit changin' It's still the same shit and Shady's still a lady killer Since the day I went insane and then attacked the babysitter With a potato peeler And mushed her face into the entertainment center It's like another plane just entered into Ukraine again Or the Bermuda Triangle And attempted to make a safe descent Awaiting anyone who ain't affiliated, it could be danger Did you make arrangements with the gangsters 'fore you came here?

Hey, Em, let me get that instrumental Take it down to the hood Let the little homies get this remix crackin'! Detroit! Okay! 
Yeah, trying to figure out the difference But I think the lines are starting to get blurred [Verse 1] I'm in a strange place I feel like Ma$e when he gave up the game for his faith I feel like I'm caged in these chains and restraints Grimming every stranger in the place while I gaze into space Cause I'm mentally rearranging his face I need a change of pace cause the pace I'm working at is dangerous There's nowhere to dump this anger and thanks to this angst I done quit chicken heads cold turkey and started slowly roasting 'em Cause that's where most of my anger is baste Fuck your feelings, I feel like I play for the Saints I just want to hurt you - aim for the skanks Then aim for all these fake Kanyes, Jays, Waynes and the Drakes I'm frustrated cause ain't no more N'Sync, now I'm all out of whack I'm all out of Backstreet Boys to call out and attack I'm going all out in this rap shit and whatever the fallout is I'm strapped For battles sucka - duck, crawl out the back It's a bar fight, prepare your arsenal and beware of bar stools Flying through the air and bottles breaking, mirrors also And I ain't stopping 'til the swear jar's full "You done called every woman a slut But you're forgetting Sarah, Marshall (Palin)" Oh, my bad. Slut And next time I show up to court I'll be naked and just wear a lawsuit Judge be like "That's sharp, how much did that motherfucker cost you? Smart-ass, you're lucky I don't tear it off you And jump your bones, you sexy motherfucker You're so fucking gravy, Marshall I should start calling you 'au jus' Cause all you do is spit them lyrics out the wazoo" Evil twin, take this beat now, it's all you I believe people can change, but only for the worse I could've changed the world if it wasn't for this verse So satanic, K-Mart chains panic Cause they can't even spin back the curse words Cause they're worse when they're reversed motherfucker (Rape your mother, kill your parents) [shit, motherfucker] And these kids are like parrots, they run around the house just like terrorists Screaming, "fuck, shit, fuck" adult with a childish-like arrogance Wild ever since the day I came out I was like, merits Fuck that - I'd rather be loud and I like swearing From the first album even the gals were like "tight lyrics Dreamy eyes", but my fucking mouth was nightmare-ish And from the start of it you felt like you were part of this and Opposition felt the opposite, sometimes I listen And revisit them old albums often as I can and skim through all them bitches To make sure I keep up with my competition (ha ha) Hogger of beats, hoarder of rhymes Borderline genius who's bored of his lines And that sort of defines where I'm at and the way I feel now Feel like I might just strike first and ignore the replies [Bridge] There's darkness closing in, there it goes again It controls my pen, but that ain't me, it's my evil twin (Then I step out and see my evil twin, he gives me an evil grin) But he's just a friend, who pops up now and again So don't blame me, just blame him, it's my evil twin (I step out and see my evil twin, he gives me an evil grin) Welcome back to the land of the living, my friend You have slept for quite some time [Verse 2] So who's left, Lady Gaga? Mess with the Bieber Nah, F with Christina, I ain't fucking with either Jessica neither Simpson or Alba, my albums just sicker than strep with the fever Get the Cloriseptic, Excedrin, Aleve or Extra Strength Tylenol 3's, feel like I'm burning to death but I'm freezing Bed ridden and destined never to leave the Bedroom ever again like the legend of Heath-uh- Ledger, my suicide notes, barely legible read the Bottom, it's signed by the Joker, Lorena said I never can leave her She'd sever my wiener I ever deceive her Fuck that shit bitch, Give up my dick for pussy? I'd be Jerry Mathers, I ever left it to Beaver Get them titties cut off trying to mess with a cleaver Golly-wally, I vent, heat register, Jesus Ever since 1-9-9-4-6 Dresden, it was definitely my Destiny when on the steps, I met DeShaun At Osborn, I'd never make it to sophomore I just wanted to skip school and rap, used to mop floors Flip burgers and wash dishes, while I wrote rhymes trying to get props for 'em Cause I took book-smarts and swapped for 'em They were sleeping, I made 'em stop snorin' Made them break out the popcorn Now I've been hip-hop in it's tip-top form Since N.W.A was blaring through my car windows leaning on the horn Screaming "Fuck the police" like cop porn Flipped rap on its ear like I dropped corn Fuck top five, bitch, I'm top four And that includes Biggie and Pac, whore And I got an Evil Twin So who the fuck do you think that third and that fourth spot's for? And crazy as I am I'm much tamer than him And I'm nuts, then again who the fuck wants a plain Eminem? But no one's insaner than Slim, look at that (evil grin) (Evil twin) please come in, what was your name again? Hi! Faggot Look who's back with a crab up his ass Like a lobster crawled up there Two rabbits, a koala bear and a ball of hair And you're all aware I don't got it all upstairs Guess that's why I'm an addict and it's so small up there Peace to Whitney, jeez just hit me That I should call the Looney Police to come get me Cause I'm so sick of being the truth, I wish someone finally admit me To a mental hospital with Britney Oh LMFAO, no way, Jo- Se Baez couldn't beat this rap, OJ no Hooray, I'm off the hook like Casey Anthony, (hey ho) Hey-ho! I sound like I'm trying to sing the fucking chorus to "Hip Hop Hooray", no Im hollering you got bottom-end like an 8-0- 8 and I 'base' whether we're fucking off that instead of your face, so Let your low end raise, yo Tango, what you think, ho? Slow dancing or bowling? You trying to hold hands with your homie? What, you think I'm looking for romance cause I'm lonely? Change that tune, you ain't got a remote chance to control me Ho, I'm only vulnerable when I got a bo-ner Superman try to fuck me over, it won't hurt Don't try to fix me, I'm broke so I don't work So are you, but you're broke cause you don't work But all bullshit aside, I hit a stride Still Shady inside, hair every bit as dyed As it used to be when I first introduced y'all to my skittish side And blamed it on him when they tried to criticize Cause we are the same, bitch 
[Produced by Emile] Feels like a close, it's coming to, fuck am I gonna do? It's too late to start over This is the only thing I, thing I know Sometimes I feel like all I ever do is Find different ways to word the same old song Ever since I came along From the day the song called, Hi! My Name Is dropped Started thinking my name was Fault Cause any time things went wrong I was the one who they would blame it on The media made me the e-quivalent of a modern-day Genghis Khan Tried to argue, it was only entertainment, dog Gangster? Nah, courageous balls Had to change my style, they said I'm way too soft And I sound like AZ and Nas, out came the claws And the fangs been out since then But up until the instant, that I went against it It was ingrained in me that I wouldn't amount to a shitstain I thought No wonder I had to unlearn everything my brain was taught Do I really belong in this game? I pondered I just wanna play my part, should I make waves or not? So back and forth in my brain the tug of war wages on And I don't wanna seem ungrateful or disrespect the artform I was raised up on But sometimes you gotta take a loss And have people rub it in your face before you get made pissed off And keep plugging, it's your only outlet And your only outfit, so you know they gonna talk about it Better find a way to counter it quick and make it... ah Feel like I've already said this a kabillion eighty times How many times can I say the same thing different ways that rhyme? What I really wanna say is If there's anyone else that can relate to my story Bet you feel the same way I felt When I was in the same place you are When I was afraid to I was a... afraid to make a single sound Afraid I would never find a way out, out, out Afraid I'd never be found I didn't wanna go another round An angry man's power will shut you up Trip wires fill this house with tip-toed love Run out of excuses for everyone So here I am and I will not run Guts over fear, the time is near Guts over fear, I shed a tear For all the times I let you push me 'round, I let you keep me down Now I got, guts over fear, guts over fear Feels like a close, it's coming to, fuck am I gonna do? It's too late to start over This is the only thing I, thing I know I know what it was like, I was there once, single parents Hate your appearance As you struggle to find your place in this world And the pain spawns all the anger on But it wasn't 'til I put the pain in song, learned who to aim it on That I made a spark, started to spit hard as shit Learned how to harness it while the reins were off And there was a lot of bizarre shit, but the crazy part Was soon as I stopped saying I gave a fuck Haters started to appreciate my art And it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain I caused But what am I gonna do when the rage is gone? And the lights go out in that trailer park And the window is closing And there's nowhere else that I can go with flows And I'm frozen, cause there's no more emotion for me to pull from Just a bunch of playful songs, that I make for fun So, to the break of dawn, here I go recycling the same old song But I rather make Not Afraid 2 Than make another motherfuckin' We Made You Now I don't wanna seem indulgent When I discuss my lows and my highs My demise and my uprise, pray to God I just open enough eyes later on And gave you the supplies and the tools To hopefully use that'll make you strong Enough to lift yourself up, when you feel like I felt Cause I can't explain to y'all how dang exhausted my legs felt Just having to balance my dang self When on eggshells, I was made to walk But thank you, ma, cause that gave me the Strength to cause Shady-mania, so when they empty that stadium Least I made it out of that house And found a place in this world when the day was done So this is for every kid who all's they ever did was dreamt of one day just getting accepted I represent him or her, anyone similar You are the reason that I made this song And everything you're scared to say don't be afraid to say no more From this day forward, just let them a-holes talk Take it with a grain of salt and eat their fucking faces off The legend of the angry blonde lives on through you when Im gone And to think I was a... I was a... afraid to make a single sound Afraid I would never find a way out, out, out Afraid I'd never be found I didn't wanna go another round An angry man's power will shut you up Trip wires fill this house with tip-toed love Run out of excuses for everyone So here I am and I will not run Guts over fear, the time is near Guts over fear, I shed a tear For all the times I let you push me 'round, I let you keep me down Now I got, guts over fear, guts over fear 
[Produced by Emile Haynie & Jeff Bhasker] [Intro: Nate Ruess] Mom, I know I let you down And though you say the days are happy Why is the power off and I'm fucked up and Mom, I know he's not around But don't you place the blame on me As you pour yourself another drink, yeah I guess, we are who we are Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on Maybe we took this too far I went in headfirst, never thinking about who what I said hurt In what verse, my mom probably got it the worst, the brunt of it But as stubborn as we are, did I take it too far, "Cleanin' Out My Closet" And all them other songs but regardless I don't hate you Cause ma, you're still beautiful to me, cause you're my mom Though far be it from you to be calm, our house was Vietnam Desert Storm and both of us put together could form an atomic bomb Equivalent to chemical warfare and forever we could drag this on and on But, agree to disagree, that gift for me up under the Christmas tree Don't mean shit to me you're kicking me out? It's 15 degrees and It's Christmas Eve, "Little prick, just leave," ma, let me grab my fucking coat Anything to have each other's goats, why we always at each others throats 'specially when dad, he fucked us both, we're in the same fucking boat You'd think that'd make us close, nope further away it drove us, but together Headlights shine, and a car full of belongings Still got a ways to go back to grandma's house, it's straight up the road And I was the man of the house, the oldest, so my shoulders carried The weight of the load then Nate got taken away by the state at eight years old And that's when I realized you were sick and it wasn't fixable or changeable And to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though, but... I guess, we are who we are Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on Maybe we took this too far Cause to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though Cause you ain't even get to witness your grandbabies grow But I'm sorry momma for "Cleanin' Out My Closet" At the time I was angry rightfully? Maybe so Never meant that far to take it though Cause, now I know it's not your fault and I'm not making jokes That song I no longer play at shows and I cringe every time it's on the radio And I think of Nathan being placed in a home And all the medicine you fed us and how I just wanted you to taste your own But now the medication's taking over And your mental state's deteriorating slow and I'm way too old to cry The shit is painful though but ma, I forgive you, so does Nathan, yo All you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us both Foster care, that cross you bear, few may be as heavy as yours But I love you, Debbie Mathers, oh, what a tangled web we have Cause, one thing I never asked was where the fuck my deadbeat dad was Fuck it, I guess he had trouble keeping up with every address But I'd have flipped every mattress, every rock and desert cactus Owned a collection of maps and followed my kids to the edge of the atlas If someone ever moved 'em from me, that you could've bet your asses If I had to come down the chimney dressed as Santa, kidnap 'em And although one has only met their grandma once, you pulled up In our drive one night, as we were leaving to get some hamburgers Me, her and Nate, we introduced you, hugged you And as you left I had this overwhelming sadness Come over me as we pulled off to go our separate paths And I saw your headlights as I looked back and I'm mad I didn't get the chance to thank you for being my mom and my dad So mom, please accept this as a tribute I wrote this on the jet, I guess I had to get this off my chest, I hope I get the chance to lay it 'fore I'm dead The stewardess said to fasten my seatbelt, I guess we're crashing So if I'm not dreaming, I hope you get this message That I'll always love you from afar cause you're my ma I guess, we are who we are Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on Maybe we took this too far [Bridge: Nate Ruess] I want a new life (Start over) One without a cause (Clean slate) So I'm coming home tonight Well, no matter what the cost And if the plane goes down Or if the crew can't wake me up Well, just know that I'm alright I was not afraid to die Oh, even if there's songs to sing My children will carry me Just know that I'm alright I was not afraid to die Because I put my faith in my little girls So I never say goodbye cruel world Just know that I'm alright I am not afraid to die I guess, we are who we are Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on Maybe we took this too far

(Okay) [Verse 1] Don't make me wake this baby! She don't need to see what I'm 'bout to do Quit crying, bitch! Why do you always make me shout at you?! How could you just leave me and love him out the blue?! Oh, what's the matter, Kim? Am I too loud for you?! Too bad, bitch! You're gonna finally hear me out this time! At first, I'm like: "Aight, you wanna throw me out; that's fine!" But not for him to take my place; are you out your mind?! This couch, this TV, this whole house is mine! Look it, Kim! Look at your husband now! (No!) I said, look at him! He ain't so hot now, is he, little punk?! (Why are you doing this?!) Shut the fuck up! (You're drunk! You're never gonna get away with this!) You think I give a fuck?! Come on! We're going for a ride, bitch! (No!) Sit up front! (We can't just leave Hailie alone, what if she wakes up?) We'll be right back; well, I will: you'll be in the trunk! So long, bitch, you did me so wrong I don't wanna go on Living in this world without you You really fucked me Kim! You really did a number on me! Never knew me cheatin' on you would come back to haunt me But we was kids then, Kim, I was only eighteen That was years ago, I thought we wiped the slate clean That's fucked up! (I love you!) Oh God, my brain is racin' (I love you!) What are you doing? Change the station! I hate this song! Does this look like a big joke? (No!) There's a [four] year-old little [boy] Laying dead with a slit throat In your living room! Ha-ha! What, you think I'm kiddin' you?! You loved him, didn't you? (No!) Bullshit, you bitch!

Oh my God, I'm cracking up, get a grip, Marshall! Hey, remember the time we went to Brian's party, and you were, like, so drunk that you threw up all over Archie? That was funny, wasn't it? (Yes) That was funny, wasn't it?! (Yes!) See, it all makes sense, doesn't it? You and your husband have a fight One of you tries to grab a knife, and during the struggle He accidentally gets his Adam's apple sliced (No!) And while this is going on, his son just woke up And he walks in, she panics And he gets his throat cut (Oh my God!)

[Produced by The New Royales] [Chorus: Gwen Stefani] Here to stay Even when I'm gone When I close my eyes Through the passage of time Kings never die I can hear the drummer drumming And the trumpets, someone's tryna summon someone, I know somethin's coming But I'm runnin' from it to be standing at the summit And plummet, how come it wasn't what I thought it was Was it, too good to be true? Have nothin', get it all but too much of it Then lose it again, did I swallow hallucinogens Cause if not, where the hell did it go? Cause here I sit in Lucifers den by the dutch oven Just choosing to sin Even if it means I'm sellin' my soul, just to be the undisputed again Do whatever I gotta do just to win Cause I got this motherfuckin' cloud over my head Crown around it, thorns on it Cracks in it, bet you morons didn't think I'd be back, did ya? How 'bout that, Im somehow now back to the underdog But no matter how loud that I bark, this sport is somethin' I never bow-out at I complain about the game, I shout and I pout, it's a love-hate But I found out that I can move a mountain of doubt Even when you bitches are countin' me out, and I appear to be down for the count Only time I ever been out and about Is drivin' around town with my fuckin' whereabouts in a doubt Cause I been lost tryna think of what I did to get here but I'm not a quitter Gotta get up, give it all I got or give up Spit on, shit on, stepped on, but kept goin' I'm tryna be headstrong but it feels like I slept on my neck wrong Cause you're moving onto the next, but is the respect gone? Cause someone told me that [Chorus: Gwen Stefani] Kings never die Don't give me that sob story liar, don't preach to the choir You ain't never even had to reach in the fire to dig deep Nobody ever handed me shit in life, not even a flyer Wouldn't even take shit into consideration Obliterate anyone in the way I think I see why a lot of rappers get on these features and try to show out on a track with me But it'd actually have to be a fuckin' blow-out to get me to re-tire Tell these new artists that kings never die I know shit has changed in this age, fuck a Twitter page Did it just say I've been upstaged? Why am I online? It's driving me crazy I'm ridin' shotgun tryna get a gauge On what's hot, but I'm not one to conform But as days pass in this shit And opinions sway, I can hear 'em say If I stay passionate maybe I can stage a miraculous Comeback as if I went away But detractors just say so much for the Renegade Someone's gonna make me blow my composure Here I go again, center stage and I feel like I'm in a cage They so want a champion to fall It's no wonder why I laugh at 'em, cause why can't we win 'em all? So fuck what these cynics say (It) just goes ta show that when my back's against the wall And I'm under a tack again, that I'll act as if I'm 'posed ta With this pent up rage, cause all these plaques in my office On the floor stacked against the door Are they just metaphors for the odds of me comin' back again? Cause all the accomplishments, accolades, awards And trophies just don't mean jack anymore If I'm here today and gone tomorrow And I'm not gonna be [Chorus: Gwen Stefani] Here to stay Even when I'm gone When I close my eyes Through the passage of time Kings never die I want it, I'm comin' to get it So you son of a bitches don't duck youre gonna get Riddick Bowed Critics'll end up in critical, think your shit is dope all you're gonna get is smoked And I ain't stopping 'til I'm on top again, all alone and on a throne Like a token of respect, or a homage poem, or an ode I've been owed Tossed in the air by my own arm, and launched so hard it broke my collarbone And when it's my time to go, I'm still not leaving Stop for no one, I don't know but I've been told an obstacle that Blocks your road, knock it over, time to go for the pot of gold, cause They say kings never die Just ask Jam Master Jay They just grow wings and they fly So, hands up, reach for the sky Try to hold on and prolong these moments Cause in a blink of an eye They'll be over Tryna secure your legacy like Shakur And ensure nobody's ever gonna be what you were So before you're leavin' this Earth You want people to feel the fury of a pure evil cerebral, berserk Deacon of words, syllable genius at work Plus I'm thinkin' that they're mistakin' my kindness for weakness, kill 'em with meanness I went from powdered milk and Farina To flippin' burgers on the grill for some peanuts At Gilbert's to arenas, call me Gilbert Arenas, still appeal to the dreamers I made it to the silverscreen but Rocky's still what the theme is Khalil on the beat cause makin' the beat aint the same feelin' to me as killin' the beat is Or fulfillin' to me is what fillin' a seat is It's that "Sound Bombing" Thirstin' Howl Common, underground, Diamond D, Outsidaz Stomach growl, throbbin' hunger, out-rhymin' everyone God just give me one shot, I swear that I won't let you down I'mma be around forever-and-a-day, even in the ground You ain't never ever gonna hear 'em say I ain't [Chorus: Gwen Stefani] Here to stay Even when I'm gone When I close my eyes Through the passage of time Kings never die [Outro: Gwen Stefani] Kings never die 
[Intro: Polina] Tell me where to go, tell me what to do, I'll be right there for you Tell me what to say, no matter if it's true, I'll say it all for you [Verse 1: Eminem] I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is fallin' Why am I so differently wired? Am I a martian? What kind of twisted experiment am I involved in? Cause I don't belong in this world That's why I'm scoffin' at authority Defiant often flyin' off at the handle at my mom, no dad So I am noncompliant at home, at school, I'm just shy and awkward And I don't need no goddamn psychologist Trying to diagnose why I have all these underlying problems Thinking he can try and solve 'em I'm outside chalking up drawings on the sidewalk and in the front drive Talking to myself, either that or inside hiding off in The corner somewhere quiet, trying not to be noticed Cause I'm crying and sobbin' I had a bad day at school so I ain't talkin' Some cocksucker shoved me into a fucking locker Cause he said that I eye-balled him [Pre-Hook: Polina] And if you fall, I'll catch you there I'll be your savior from all the wars That are fought inside your world Please have faith in my words [Hook: Polina] Cause this is my legacy, legacy, yeah This is my legacy, legacy, yeah There's no guarantee, it's not up to me, we can only see This is my legacy, legacy, legacy, legacy [Verse 2: Eminem] I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is fallin' Why am I so differently wired in my noggin? Cause sporadic as my thoughts come, it's mind-bogglin' Cause I obsess on everything in my mind Small shit bothers me, but not my father He said sayonara then split but I dont give a shit I'm fine long as there's batteries in my Walkman Nothing is the matter with me Shit look on the bright side at least I ain't walkin' I bike ride through the neighborhood of my apartment Complex on a ten-speed which I've acquired parts that I find in the garbage, a frame then put tires on it Headphones on, look straight ahead if kids try and start shit But if this is all there is for me, life offers Why bother even trying to put up a fight? It's nonsense But I think a light bulb just lit up in my conscience What about them rhymes I've been jottin' They are kind of giving me confidence Instead of trying to escape through my comics Why don't I just blast a little something, like Onyx To put me in the mood to wanna fight and write songs that Say what I want to say to the kid that said that I eyeballed him Grab hold of my balls like that's right, fight's on bitch Who woulda knew from the moment I turned the mic on that I could be iconic, in my conquest That's word to Phife Dawg from a Tribe Called Quest [Hook: Polina] Cause this is my legacy, legacy, yeah This is my legacy, legacy, yeah There's no guarantee, it's not up to me, we can only see This is my legacy, legacy, legacy, legacy [Verse 3: Eminem] I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is fallin' Now I think the fact that I'm differently wired's awesome Cause if I wasn't, I wouldn't be able to work words like this And connect lines like crosswords And use my enemy's words as strength To try and draw from, and get inspired off 'em Cause all my life I was told and taught I am not shit By you wack fucking giant sacks of lying dog shit Now you shut up bitch, I am talkin' thought I was full of horseshit And now you fucking worship the ground on which I am walkin' Me against the world, so what?

Step by step, heart to heart Left, right, left We all fall down like toy soldiers Bit by bit, torn apart We never win But the battle wages on for toy soldiers I'm supposed to be the soldier Who never blows his composure Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders, I ain't never supposed to show it My crew ain't supposed to know it Even if it means going toe to toe with a Benzino It don't matter I'd never drag them in battles that I can handle 'Less I absolutely have to, I'm supposed to set an example I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em If some shit ever does pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em That Ja shit, I tried to squash it It was too late to stop it There's a certain line you just don't cross, and he crossed it I heard him say Hailie's name on a song And I just lost it; it was crazy The shit went way beyond some Jay Z and Nas shit And even though the battle is won, I feel like we lost it I spent so much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted And I'm so caught in it I almost feel I'm the one who caused it This ain't what I'm in hip hop for, it's not why I got in it That was never my object, for someone to get killed Why would I want to destroy something I helped build? It wasn't my intentions, my intentions were good I went through my whole career Without ever mentioning [Suge] And that was just outta respect, for not running my mouth And talking about something that I knew nothing about Plus Dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef So I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth While he's all over TV Down-talking the man who literally saved my life Like, fuck it, I understand This is business, and this shit just isn't none of my business I'm still knowing this shit could pop off at any minute, cause Step by step, heart to heart Left, right, left We all fall down like toy soldiers Bit by bit, torn apart We never win But the battle wages on for toy soldiers There used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme and Wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin' But now it's elevated Cause once you put someone's kids in it The shit gets escalated; it ain't just words no more, is it? It's a different ball game You call names and you ain't just rappin' We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin' Me and Dre had sat with him Kicked it and had a chat with him And asked him not to start it, he wasn't gonna go after him Until Ja started yappin' in magazines how he stabbed him Fuck it, "50, smash him! Mash him and let him have it!" Meanwhile my attention's pulled in another direction Some receptionist at the Source Who answers phones at his desk Has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record But now he's fucked the game up, cause one of the ways I came up, was through that publication The same one that made me famous Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin'? Well, fuck it, that mothafucka could get it too, fuck him then! But I'm so busy being pissed off, I don't stop to think That we just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc And he's inherited mine, which is fine Ain't like either of us mind We still have soldiers that's on the front line That's willing to die for us as soon as we give the orders Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us And maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in the chorus To show 'em we love 'em back And let them know how important it is To have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our corners Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is But I ain't tryin' to have none of my people hurt or murdered It ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it Than to just say that I love y'all too much to see the verdict I'll walk away from it all 'fore I let it go any further it's not a plea that I'm coppin' I'm just willing to be the bigger man if y'all can quit poppin' Off at your jaws, well, then I can Cause frankly I'm sick of talkin'. I'm not going to let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience, cause [Hook] Step by step, heart to heart Left, right, left We all fall down like toy soldiers Bit by bit, torn apart We never win But the battle wages on for toy soldiers

Snatch the bitch out her car through the window She screamin', I body slam her on the cement Until the concrete gave and created a sinkhole Buried this stink ho in it, then pay to have the street repaved (The fuck?) Woke up in a dream state, in a cold sweat like I got hit with a freeze ray during a heat wave Guess I eventually caved though, cause she's laying next to me in bed directly aiming a gat at my head Woke up again and jumped up like "Fuck it! I've had it, I'm checking into rehab." I confess I'm a static addict, I guess that's why I'm so clingy Every girl I've ever had either says I got too much baggage Or I'm too fucking dramatic Man, what the fuck is the matter? I'm just a fucking romantic I fucking love you, you fucking bitch! Combative, possessive, in fact last time I was mad at an ex I actually set off a chain reaction of tragic events I said, "Hit the road" and after she left, I sent that bitch a text I said, "Be careful driving, don't read this and have an accident" She glanced to look at it and wrecked Too bad, thought we had a connect, no sense dwelling makes Never been a more compelling case Than the model covered in L'Oreal and mace Who fell from grace eleven stories for storytelling While the whore was yelling, "Rape!" 'Til her vocal cords were swelling And her voice were more hoarser than Tori Spellings' face Still they swarm the gates and my fancy estates to greet Norman Bates with a warm embrace Unless you're Andrea Yates, don't ask me for a date Don't be late, well, the sentiment's great But wait, think there's been a mistake You wanted an intimate date, I wanna intimidate I have infinite hate in my blood It's mainly because of the game of, (*Message sound*) "Wait, dinner at eight?"

[Hook: Rihanna] Just gonna stand there and watch me burn Well, that's all right, because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry Well, that's all right, because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie [Verse 1: Eminem] I can't tell you what it really is I can only tell you what it feels like And right now there's a steel knife in my windpipe I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight High off her love, drunk from her hate It's like I'm huffing paint and I love her the more I suffer I suffocate and right before I'm about to drown She resuscitates me, she fucking hates me, and I love it Wait, where you going? I'm leaving you No, you ain't, come back!" We're running right back, here we go again It's so insane, cause when it's going good, it's going great I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane But when it's bad it's awful, I feel so ashamed I snap, Who's that dude?, I don't even know his name I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again I guess I don't know my own strength [Hook: Rihanna] Just gonna stand there and watch me burn Well, that's all right, because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry Well, that's all right, because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie [Verse 2: Eminem] You ever love somebody so much You can barely breathe when you're with them? You meet, and neither one of you even know what hit them Got that warm fuzzy feeling Yeah, them chills used to get them Now you're getting fucking sick of looking at them? You swore you'd never hit them, never do nothing to hurt them Now you're in each other's face Spewing venom in your words when you spit them You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit them So lost in the moments when you're in 'em It's the rage that took over, it controls you both So they say it's best to go your separate ways Guess that they don't know you Cause today, that was yesterday Yesterday is over, it's a different day Sound like broken records playing over But you promised her next time you'd show restraint You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game But you lied again Now you get to watch her leave out the window Guess that's why they call it window pane [Hook: Rihanna] Just gonna stand there and watch me burn Well, that's all right, because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry Well, that's all right, because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie [Verse 3: Eminem] Now, I know we said things, did things, that we didn't mean And we fall back into the same patterns, same routines But your temper's just as bad as mine is You're the same as me When it comes to love, you're just as blinded Baby, please come back, it wasn't you, baby it was me Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano All I know is I love you too much to walk away though Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk? Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball Next time I'm pissed I'll aim my fist at the drywall Next time? There won't be no next time I apologize even though I know it's lies I'm tired of the games, I just want her back I know I'm a liar, if she ever tries to fucking leave again I'ma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire [Hook: Rihanna] Just gonna stand there and watch me burn Well, that's all right, because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry Well, that's all right, because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie

All I had to do was go in her room and lift up her mattress Which is it, bitch: Mrs. Briggs or Ms. Mathers? It doesn't matter, [your attorney Fred Gibson's a] faggot Talking about I fabricated my past He's just aggravated I won't ejaculate in his ass So tell me, what the hell is a fella to do? For every million I make, another relative sues Family fighting and fussing Over who wants to invite me to supper All of a sudden, I got ninety-some cousins A half-brother and sister who never seen me Or even bothered to call me until they saw me on TV Now everybody's so happy and proud I'm finally allowed to step foot in my girlfriend's house (Hey!) And then to top it off I walked to the news stand To buy this cheap-ass little magazine with a food stamp Skipped to the last page, flipped right fast And what do I see?

Yeah, I know sometimes Things may not always make sense to you right now But hey, what'd Daddy always tell you? Straighten up, little soldier! Stiffen up that upper lip! What you cryin' about? You got me Hailie, I know you miss your mom And I know you miss your dad when I'm gone But I'm tryin' to give you the life that I never had I can see you're sad Even when you smile, even when you laugh I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you wanna cry Cause you're scared, I ain't there Daddy's with you in your prayers No more crying, wipe them tears Daddy's here, no more nightmares We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it Lainie, Uncle's crazy, ain't he? Yeah, but he loves you, girl, and you better know it We're all we got in this world When it spins, when it swirls, when it whirls, when it twirls Two little beautiful girls Looking puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusing you Daddy's always on the move Momma's always on the news I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me All the things growing up as Daddy that he had to see Daddy don't want you to see But you see just as much as he did We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me But things have got so bad between us I don't see us ever being together ever again Like we used to be when we was teenagers But then, of course, everything always happens for a reason I guess it was never meant to be But it's just something we have no control over And that's what destiny is But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep Maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream Now hush, little baby, don't you cry Everything's gonna be alright Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya Daddy's here to hold ya through the night I know Mommy's not here right now And we don't know why We fear how we feel inside It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby But I promise, Momma's gon' be alright Heh, it's funny I remember back one year when Daddy had no money Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up And stuck 'em under the tree And said some of 'em were from me Cause daddy couldn't buy 'em I'll never forget that Christmas, I sat up the whole night cryin' Cause Daddy felt like a bum, see, Daddy had a job But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and Mom And at the time, every house that we lived in Either kept gettin' broken into and robbed Or shot up on the block And your mom was saving money for you in a jar Tryin' to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college Almost had a thousand dollars 'Til someone broke in and stole it And I know it hurt so bad it broke your momma's heart And it seemed like everything was just starting to fall apart Mom and Dad was arguing a lot, so Momma moved back On to Chalmers in the flat, one bedroom apartment And Dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara And that's when Daddy went to California with his CD And met Dr. Dre, and flew you and Momma out to see me But Daddy had to work, you and Momma had to leave me Then you started seeing Daddy on the TV And Momma didn't like it And you and Lainie were too young to understand it Papa was a rolling stone, Momma developed a habit And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud Now I'm sittin' in this empty house Just reminiscing, looking at your baby pictures It just trips me out to see how much you both have grown It's almost like you're sisters now Wow, guess you pretty much are, and Daddy's still here Lainie, I'm talking to you too, Daddy's still here I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it? Sssshhh! Momma's only gone for the moment Now hush, little baby, don't you cry Everything's gonna be alright Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya Daddy's here to hold ya through the night I know Mommy's not here right now And we don't know why We fear how we feel inside It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby But I promise, Momma's gon' be alright And if you ask me to, Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird I'mma give you the world I'mma buy a diamond ring for you, I'mma sing for you I'll do anything for you to see you smile And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine I'ma break that birdie's neck I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya And make him eat every carat; don't fuck with Dad! Ha ha!

"So why's your face red? Man, you wasted!" Well, since age twelve I felt like I'm someone else Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off, and smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross I smoke a fat pound of grass, and fall on my ass Faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast Come here, slut!

I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive Am I coming or going? I can barely decide I just drank a fifth of vodka, dare me to drive? All my life I was very deprived I ain't had a woman in years, my palms too hairy to hide Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits How you gonna breastfeed me, Mom? You ain't got no tits! I lay awake and strap myself in the bed Put a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head I'm steaming mad and by the way, when you see my dad Tell him that I slit his throat in this dream I had Hi, my name is, what?

I am phenomenal With every ounce of my blood With every breath in my lungs Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal I am phenomenal However long that it takes I'll go to whatever lengths It's gonna make me a monster though I am phenomenal But I'll never say, Oh, its impossible Cause I'm born to be phenomenal Unstoppable, unpoppable thought bubbles Untoppable thoughts, fuckin' juggernaut that'll Stomp you in a verse, obstacles I'm drawn to 'em When the going got rough Some of what I done fought through was the worst, little sissy Who the fuck taught you how to persevere? There ain't no situation that you ever had to respond to that's adverse The messiest thing you've ever gone through was your purse Yeah, I don't try like hell, then I might as well Hang it up like a shelf, gotta keep growin' with it, evolve Cause you can keep throwin' shit at the wall But you're gonna find that nothing's gonna stick until you apply yourself Time to slip in that zone 'til I find myself Inside the realm of the unknown and boldly go Into waters where nobody else has gone before Or willing to go, uncharted, feeling is so Bomb, I'm feelin' myself, I'm a giant Sometimes I gotta remind myself that I am... I am phenomenal With every ounce of my blood With every breath in my lungs Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal I am phenomenal However long that it takes I'll go to whatever lengths It's gonna make me a monster though I am phenomenal But I'll never say, Oh, its impossible Cause I'm born to be phenomenal Let me self-empower you When you're down and they're tryin' to clown the fuck out of you And you feel like you're runnin' out of fuel I'll show you how to use doubt as fuel Convert it to gunpowder too Now what you do is put the match to the charcoal fluid Put the spark to it like Martha Stewart barbecuing Ah screw it, feel like you want to hit that wall then do it Punch through it, just cock back, put your all into it Now you gon' take that rage and make that what you wage Never take back what you say If you stay strapped in your brain, engaged in a steel cage match Ready to scrap asap Take your fists and just ball it Show who's big and who's smallest you're Christopher Wallace Now picture 'em all as plastic and foam Lays flat, where you put your dinner plates at And set it on 'em like a placemat (I am phenomenal) And I want you to say that I am phenomenal With every ounce of my blood With every breath in my lungs Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal I am phenomenal However long that it takes I'll go to whatever lengths It's gonna make me a monster though I am phenomenal But I'll never say, Oh, its impossible Cause I'm born to be phenomenal [Bridge] Oh, step into the unknown and find yourself Youre floating freely, no emotion Got a fuckin mouth with no shut-off valve Can't even cut off power to it, but it's what allowed Me to come up out from under the fuckin' ground Cause I worked my butt off now It's a subject that I don't know how to shut up about Cause I stuck it out Like a motherfuckin' tongue thats how I responded when I got shoved around You're gonna have non-believers But when you're beyond belief, you probably shouldn't wonder how Get it how you live But are you prepared to give more than you get? And put in twice what you get back from this shit Though what you sacrifice barely is half, never give Rap is my shiv But it's like my shield at the same time I wield and my knife is will Sometimes I feel just like B. Real from Cypress Hill How I can just kill a cypher, survivor's guilt I rhyme like life is still an uphill climb Ready to face any challenge, waitin' Can taste it, it's salivation, I'm wagin' retaliation Look what I have built, reputation is validation The only thing I'm capable of makin' is amazing Only thing you're capable of makin' is a false statement Or accusation... I am legendary status, in fact That is the only way you'll ever be able to say You're a legend is makin' an allegation I write with the left, same hand I hold the mic with As I fight to the death, 'til my last breath Manage to prove who the best man is Prevail at all costs, be the only ones left standin' In the end, but I ain't gonna be the only one with the advantage Of knowin' what it's like to be southpaw Cause you can bet your ass you'll be left handed Cause I am I am phenomenal With every ounce of my blood With every breath in my lungs Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal I am phenomenal However long that it takes I'll go to whatever lengths It's gonna make me a monster though I am phenomenal But I'll never say, Oh, its impossible Cause I'm born to be phenomenal 
[Produced by DVLP] [Intro sample + Eminem] Look, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings But I'm only going to get this one chance Something's wrong, I can feel it Six minutes. Six Minutes. Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on! Just a feeling I've got Like something's about to happen, but I don't know what If that means what I think it means We're in trouble, big trouble And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances You are just what the doc ordered [Verse 1] I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box? They said I rap like a robot, so call me rap-bot But for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes I got a laptop in my back pocket My pen'll go off when I half-cock it Got a fat knot from that rap profit Made a livin' and a killin' off it Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his, nutsack I'm an MC still as honest But as rude and as indecent as all hell Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with) This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match with this rappity-rap Packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac' Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack And at the exact same time I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicing that I'll still be able to break a mothafuckin' table Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half Only realized it was ironic I was signed to Aftermath after the fact How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs Feel my wrath of attack Rappers are having a rough time period, here's a maxi pad It's actually disastrously bad for the wack While I'm masterfully constructing this master piece [Verse 2] Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box? Let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard, that hard Everybody want the key and the secret To rap immortality like I have got Well, to be truthful the blueprint's Simply rage and youthful exuberance Everybody loves to root for a nuisance Hit the Earth like an asteroid Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew) MC's get taken to school with this music Cause I use it as a vehicle to "bus the rhyme" Now I lead a new school full of students Me? I'm a product of Rakim, Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A., Cube, hey, Doc, Ren, Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim Inspired enough to one day grow up Blow up and be in a position To meet RunD.M.C., and induct them Into the mothafuckin' Rock 'n Roll Hall of Fame Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame On the wall of (shame) You fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'? Little gay-looking boy So gay I can barely say it with a straight face, looking boy You're witnessing a massacre, like you're watching a church gathering take place, looking boy "Oy vey, that boy's gay!", that's all they say, looking boy You get a thumbs up, pat on the back And a "way to go" from your label every day, looking boy Hey, looking boy, what you say, looking boy? I get a "hell yeah" from Dre, looking boy I'ma work for everything I have, never ask nobody for shit Get outta my face, looking boy! Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable Of keeping up with the same pace, looking boy [Verse 3] Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod The way I'm racing around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God Kneel before General Zod This planet's Krypton; no, Asgard, Asgard So you be Thor and I'll be Odin, you rodent, I'm omnipotent Let off then I'm reloadin' Immediately with these bombs I'm totin' And I should not be woken; I'm the walking dead But I'm just a talking head, a zombie floatin' But I got your mom deep throatin' I'm out my Ramen Noodle We have nothing in common, poodle I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm And pay homage, pupil It's me, my honesty's brutal But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though For good at least once in a while So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes To maybe try to help get some people through tough times But I gotta keep a few punchlines Just in case, cause even you unsigned Rappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime I know there was a time where once I Was king of the underground But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine Appeal with the skin color of mine You get too big and here they come tryin' to Censor you, like that one line I said on "I'm Back" from the Mathers LP 1 when I tried to say "I'll take seven kids from Columbine Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9" See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm Morphin' into an immortal, coming through the portal You're stuck in a time warp from 2004, though And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for You're pointless as Rapunzel with fucking Cornrows You write normal? Fuck being normal And I just bought a new raygun from the future Just to come and shoot ya Like when Fabolous made Ray J mad Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad Singing to a man while they played piano Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel So Ray J went straight to the radio station The very next day, "Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!" Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad) Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma You assuming I'm a human What I gotta do to get it through to you? I'm superhuman Innovative and I'm made of rubber So that anything you say is ricocheting off of me And it'll glue to you and I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating how to give a mothafuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated I make elevating music, you make elevator music "Oh, he's too mainstream" Well, that's what they do when they get jealous They confuse it; "It's not hip-hop, it's pop" Cause I found a hella way to fuse it With rock, shock rap with Doc Throw on "Lose Yourself" and make 'em lose it "I don't know how to make songs like that I don't know what words to use" Let me know when it occurs to you While I'm ripping any one of these verses that versus you It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurting you How many verses I gotta murder to Prove that if you were half as nice Your songs you could sacrifice virgins to? Ungh, school flunky, pill junkie But look at the accolades these skills brung me Full of myself, but still hungry I bully myself, cause I make me do what I put my mind to And I'm a million leagues above you Ill when I speak in tongues But it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you! I'm drunk, so Satan, take the fucking wheel! I'm asleep in the front seat Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still "Chunky but Funky" But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me They're asking me to eliminate some of the women hate But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I have Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic To the situation and understand the discrimination But fuck it, life's handing you lemons Make lemonade then! But if I can't batter the women How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then? Don't mistake him for Satan; it's a fatal mistake If you think I need to be overseas And take a vacation to trip a broad And make her fall on her face and Don't be a retard, be a king? Think not Why be a king when you can be a God? 
[Intro] (What's your name?) Marshall (Who's your daddy?) I don't have one My mother reproduced like the komodo dragon And had me on the back of a motorcycle, then crashed in The side of loco-motive with rap, I'm Loco, it's like handing a psycho a loaded handgun Michelangelo with a paint gun in a tantrum 'Bout to explode all over the canvas Back with the Yoda of rap, "In a spasm Your music usually has 'em But waned for the game your enthusiasm it hasn't Follow you must, Rick Rubin my little Padawan" A Jedi in training, colossal brain and, thoughts are entertainin' But docile and impossible to explain and, I'm also vain and Probably find a way to complain about a Picasso painting Puke Skywalker, but sound like Chewbacca when I talk Full of such blind rage I need a seein' eye dog Can't even find the page I was writing this rhyme on Oh it's on the ram-page, couldn't see what I wrote I write small It says, "Ever since I drove a '79 Lincoln with whitewall, had a fire in my heart And a dire desire to aspire to Die Hard" So as long as I'm on the clock punching this time card Hip-hop ain't dying on my watch [Hook] Now sometimes, when I'm sleepin' She comes to me in my dreams Is she taken? Is she mine? Don't got time, don't care, don't have two shits to give Let me take you by the hand to promised land And threaten everyone Cause there's no rhyme or no reason for nothing [Bridge] (What's your name?) Marshall (Who's your daddy?) I dont know him, but I wonder (Is he rich like me?) Ha (Has he taken, any time, to show you what you need to live?)  [Verse 2] No, if he had He wouldn't have ended up in these rhymes on my pad I wouldn't be so mad, my attitude wouldn't be so bad Yeah Dad I'm the epitome and the prime Example of what happens when the power of the rhyme Falls into the wrong hands, and Makes you want to get up and start dancin' Even if it is Charles Manson Who just happens, to be rapping, blue lights flashing Laughing all the way to the bank, lamping in my K-Mart mansion Im in the style department With a pile in my cart, ripping the aisle apart but With great power comes absolutely no responsibility for content Completely, despondent and condescending The king of nonsense and controversy is on a beat killing spree Your honor, I must plead guilty, cause I sparked a revolution Rebel without a cause who caused the evolution Of rap, to take it to the next level, boost it But several rebuked it, and whoever produced it ("Hip-hop is the devil's music") Does that mean it belongs to me? Cause I just happen to be, a white honky devil with two horns That don't honk but every time I speak you hear a beep But, lyrically, I never hear a peep, not even a whisper Rappers better stay clear of me, bitch, It's the time of the season, when hate runs high And this time, I won't give it to you easy When I take back what's mine with pleasured hands And torture everyone, that is my plan My job here isn't done Cause there's no rhyme or no reason for nothing (What's your name?) Shady (Who's your daddy?) I dont give a fuck, but I wonder (Is he rich like me?) Doubt it, ha (Has he taken, any time, to show you what you need to live?) So yeah, Dad, let's walk Let's have us a father and son talk But I bet we wouldn't probably get one block Without me knocking your block off, this is all your fault Maybe that's why I'm so bananas, I a-ppealed to all those walks Of life, whoever had strife Maybe that's what dad and son talks are like Cause I, related to the struggles of young America When their fucking parents were unaware of their troubles Now they're ripping out their fucking hair again, it's hysterical I chuckle, as everybody bloodies their bare knuckles Yeah uh-oh, better beware knuckle heads The sign of my hustle says "Don't knock, the door's broken, it won't lock It might just fly open, get cold-cocked You critics come to pay me a visit? Misery loves company, please stay a minute Kryptonite to a hypocrite, zip your lip if you dish it but can't take it Too busy getting stoned in your glass house, to kick rocks Then you wonder why I lash out Mr. Mathers as advertised on the flyers, so spread the word Cause I'm promoting my passion until I'm passed out Completely brain dead, Rain Man Doing a Bankhead in a restraint chair So, bitch, shoot me a look, it better be a blank stare Or get shanked in the pancreas I'm angrier than all eight other reindeer put together with Chief Keef Cause I hate every fucking thing, yeah Even this rhyme, bitch And quit trying look for a fucking reason for it that ain't there But I still am a "Criminal!" Ten-year-old degenerate grabbing on my genitals! The last Mathers LP done went diamond This time I'm predicting this one will go emerald! When will the madness end, how can it when There's no method to the pad and pen The only message that I have to send is, Dad I'm back at it again Yeah... (Who's your daddy?) 
[Verse 1] These ideas are nightmares to white parents, whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings Like whatever they say has no bearing It's so scary in a house that allows no swearing To see him walking around with his headphones blaring Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care He's a problem child, and what bothers him all comes out When he talks about his fucking dad walking out Cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out If he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out His thoughts are wacked, he's mad so he's talking back Talking black, brainwashed from rock and rap He sags his pants, doo-rags and a stocking cap His step-father hit him so he socked him back And broke his nose, his house is a broken home There's no control, he just lets his emotions go [Hook] Sing with me, sing for the year (Sing it!) Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear (Come on!) Sing it with me, just for today Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away [Verse 2] Entertainment is changing, intertwining with gangsters In the land of the killers a sinner's mind is a sanctum Holy or unholy, only have one homie Only this gun, lonely cause don't anyone know me Yet everybody just feels like they can relate I guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great Or they can degrade, or even worse, they can teach hate It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen? From standing on corners and porches just rappin' To having a fortune, no more kissing ass But then these critics crucify you, journalists try to burn you Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you To get they hands on every dime you have They want you to lose your mind every time you mad So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly But all their kids been listening to me religiously So I'm signing CDs while police fingerprint me They're for the judge's daughter, but his grudge is against me If I'm such a fucking menace, this shit doesn't make sense, B It's all political, if my music is literal And I'm a criminal, how the fuck can I raise a little girl? I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to You're full of shit too, Guerrera; that was a fist that hit you [Hook] Sing with me, sing for the year (Sing it!) Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear (Sing this shit!) Sing it with me, just for today Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away They say music can alter moods and talk to you Well, can it load a gun up for you and cock it too? Well, if it can, then the next time you assault a dude Just tell the judge it was my fault, and I'll get sued See, what these kids do is hear about us toting pistols And they wanna get one cause they think the shit's cool Not knowing we really just protecting ourselves We entertainers, of course the shit's affecting our sales You ignoramus, but music is reflection of self We just explain it, and then we get our checks in the mail It's fucked up, ain't it? How we can come from practically nothin' To being able to have any fucking thing that we wanted That's why we sing for these kids who don't have a thing Except for a dream and a fucking rap magazine Who post pin-up pictures on they walls all day long Idolize their favorite rappers and know all their songs Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives So they sit and they cry at night wishing they'd die 'Til they throw on a rap record, and they sit and they vibe We're nothing to you, but we're the fucking shit in their eyes That's why we seize the moment Try to freeze it and own it, squeeze it and hold it Cause we consider these minutes golden And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone Just let our spirits live on Through our lyrics that you hear in our songs, and we can [Hook] Sing with me, sing for the year (Sing it!) Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear (Come on!) Sing it with me, just for today Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away Sing with me, sing for the year (Sing it!) Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear (Come on!) Sing it with me, just for today Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away

You know the song by Phil Collins "In the Air of the Night" about that guy who could've saved that other guy from drownin' But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him? That's kinda how this is You could've rescued me from drowning Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall I loved you, Slim, we could've been together think about it!

You got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counselin' To help your ass from bouncin' off the walls When you get down some And what's this shit about us meant to be together? That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other I really think you and your girlfriend need each other Or maybe you just need to treat her better I hope you get to read this letter I just hope it reaches you in time Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doing just fine If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you But Stan, why are you so mad? Try to understand that I do want you as a fan I just don't want you to do some crazy shit; I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge And had his girlfriend in the trunk And she was pregnant with his kid And in the car they found a tape But they didn't say who it was to Come to think about it, his name was it was you, damn

And you've had enough of me I smother you, I'm 'bout to jump off the edge But you won't break me, you'll just make me stronger than I was Before I met you, I bet you I'll be just fine without you And if I stumble, I won't crumble, I'll get back up and uhh But I'mma still be humble when I scream "Fuck you" Cause I'm stronger than I was A beautiful face is all that you have Cause on the inside you're ugly and mad But you're all that I love, I grasp, you can't leave Please stay here with me, baby hold me please And I'd beg and I plead, drop to knees And I'd cry and I'd scream, baby, please don't leave But you left and you took everything I had left And left nothing, nothing for me So please don't wake me from this dream, baby We're still together in my head And you're still in love with me 'til I woke up to discover that that dream was dead But you won't break me, you'll just make me stronger than I was Before I met you, I bet you I'll be just fine without you And if I stumble, I won't crumble, I'll get back up and uhh But I'mma still be humble when I scream "Fuck you" Cause I'm stronger than I was [Verse 3] You walked out, I almost died, it was almost a homicide That you caused cause I was so traumatized Felt like I was in for a long bus ride I'd rather die than you not be by my side Can't count how many times I vomited, cried Go to my room, turn the radio on and hide Thought we were Bonnie and Clyde, nah On the inside you were Jekyll and Hyde I, felt like my, whole relationship with you was a lie It was you and I, why did I think it was ride or die? Cause if you coulda, took my life you woulda It's like you put a, knife through my chest And pushed it right through to the, other side Of my back and stuck a spike too, shoulda Put up more of a fight, but I couldn't At the time, no one could hurt me like you coulda Take you back now, what's the likelihood of that? Bite me bitch, chew on a nineteen footer Cause this morning I finally stood up Held my chin up finally showed a sign Of life in me for the, first time since you left me And left me with nothing but shattered dreams And the life we coulda, had and we could've been But I'm breaking out of this slump I'm in Pulling myself out of the dumps once again I'm getting up once and for all, fuck this shit I'ma be late for the pity party But you're never gonna beat me to the fucking punch again Took it on the chin like a champ So don't lump me in with the chump-ions I'm done being your punching bag It was the November 31st today Would've been our anniversary Two years but you left on the 1st of May I wrote it on a calendar, was gonna call But couldn't think of the words to say But they came to me just now So I put 'em in a verse to lay [Bridge] And I thank you cause you made me a better person than I was But I hate you cause you drained me, I gave you all, you gave me none But if you blame me, you're crazy and after all is said and done I'm still angry, yeah, I may be, I may never trust someone But you won't break me, you'll just make me stronger than I was Before I met you, I bet you I'll be just fine without you And if I stumble, I won't crumble, I'll get back up and uhh But I'mma still be humble when I scream "Fuck you" Cause I'm stronger than I was

[Hook: Liz Rodrigues] This is survival of the fittest This is do or die This is the winner takes it all So take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all [Verse 1: Eminem] Wasn't ready to be no millionaire, I was ill-prepared I was prepared to be ill though, the skill was there From the beginning, it wasn't 'bout the ends It was 'bout busting raps And standing for something; fuckin' acronym Cut the fucking act like you're happy, I'm fuckin' back again With another anthem, why stop when it doesn't have to end? It ain't over 'til I say it's over enough when I say enough Throw me to them wolves and close the gate up I'm afraid of what'll happen to them wolves, when the thought Of being thrown into an alligator pit, I salivate at it, wait is up Hands up like it's 12 noon Nah, homie, hold them bitches straighter up Wave 'em 'til you dislocate a rotator cuff, came up rough Came to ruffle feathers, nah, egos, I ain't deflate enough Last chance to make this whole stadium erupt, cause [Hook: Liz Rodrigues] This is survival of the fittest This is do or die This is the winner takes it all So take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all I can see the finish line with each line that I finish I'm so close to my goals I can almost pole vault over the goal post And if I don't got enough in the tank Maybe I can just siphon enough To fill up this last can Man, will I survive in this climate or what? They said I was washed up, and got a blood bath I'm not a rapper, I'm an adapter I can adjust Plus, I can just walk up to a mic and just bust So, floor's open if you'd like to discuss Top 5 in this mothafucka, and if I don't make the cut, what? Like I give a fuck But I light this bitch up like I'm driving a truck Through the side of a pump, 0 to 60, hop in and gun it Like G-Unit without the hyphen, I'm hyping 'em up And if there should ever come a time where my life's in a rut And I look like I might just give up, eh, might've mistook Me for bowing out I ain't taking a bow I'm stabbing myself with a fucking knife in the gut While I'm wiping my butt Cause I just shitted on the mic and I like getting cut I get excited at the sight of my blood You're in a fight with a nut Cause I'ma fight 'til I die or win, biting the dust It'll just make me angrier; wait, let me remind you of what Got me this far, picture me quitting Now draw a circle around it and put a line through it, slut! It's survival of what? [Hook: Liz Rodrigues] This is survival of the fittest This is do or die This is the winner takes it all So take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all So get your ideas, stack your ammo But don't come unless you come to battle Now mount up, jump in the saddle This is it it's what you eat, sleep, piss and shit Live, breathe, your whole existence just consists of this Refuse to quit, fuse is lit, can't defuse the wick If I don't do this music shit, I'll lose my shit Ain't got shit to lose, it's the moment of truth It's all I know how to do As soon as I get thrown in a booth, I spit But my respect is overdue, I'm showing you the flow no one do Cause I don't own no diploma for school, I quit So there's nothing for me to fall back on, I know no other trade So you better trade your fucking mics in for some tool-box-es Cause you'll never take my pride from me It'll have to be pried from me So pull out your pliers and your screwdrivers But I want you to doubt me, I don't want you to buh-lieve Cause this is something that I must use to succeed And if you don't like me, then fuck you! Self-esteem must be fucking shooting through-the-roof Cause trust me My skin is too thick and bullet proof to touch me I can see why the fuck I disgust you I must be allergic to failure, cause everytime I come close to it I just sneeze, but I just go at you then a-chieve! [Hook: Liz Rodrigues] This is survival of the fittest This is do or die This is the winner takes it all So take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all 
[Hook: Rihanna] I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed Get along with the voices inside of my head You're trying to save me, stop holdin' your breath And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy [Verse 1: Eminem] I wanted the fame, but not the cover of Newsweek Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey Wanted to receive attention for my music Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me For wanting my cake, and eat it too, and wanting it both ways Fame made me a balloon cause my ego inflated When I blew, see, but it was confusing Cause all I wanted to do's be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam Hit the lottery, ooh-wee But with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet It was like winning a used mink Ironic cause I think I'm getting so huge I need a shrink I'm beginning to lose sleep; one sheep, two sheep Going coo-coo and kooky as Kool Keith But I'm actually weirder than you think, cause I'm [Hook: Rihanna] I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed Get along with the voices inside of my head You're trying to save me, stop holdin' your breath And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy Well, thats nothin' Well, thats nothin' Now, I ain't much of a poet but I know somebody once told me to seize the moment and don't squander it Cause you never know when it all could be over tomorrow So I keep conjuring Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from (Yeah, pondering'll do you wonders No wonder you're losing your mind, the way it wanders) Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo! I think it went wandering off down yonder And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen Cause I need an interventionist To intervene between me and this monster And save me from myself and all this conflict Cause the very thing that I love's killing me And I can't conquer it My OCD is conking me in the head, keep knocking Nobody's home, I'm sleepwalking I'm just relaying what the voice in my head is saying Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the [Hook: Rihanna] I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed Get along with the voices inside of my head You're trying to save me, stop holdin' your breath And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy Well, thats nothin' Well, thats nothin' Call me crazy, but I have this vision One day that I'll walk amongst you a regular civilian But until then drums get killed, and I'm coming straight at MCs, blood gets spilled, and I'll take it back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track Give every kid who got played that pumped up feelin' And shit to say back to the kids who played him I ain't here to save the fucking children But if one kid out of a hundred million Who are going through a struggle feels it, and Relates, that's great, it's payback, Russell Wilson Falling way back in the draft Turn nothing into something, still can Make that, straw into gold chump, I will spin Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack Maybe I need a straight jacket, face facts I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that It's nothing, I'm still friends with the [Hook: Rihanna] I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed Get along with the voices inside of my head You're trying to save me, stop holdin' your breath And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed Get along with the voices inside of my head You're trying to save me, stop holdin' your breath And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy Well, thats nothin' Well, thats nothin' 
May I have your attention, please? May I have your attention, please? Will the real Slim Shady please stand up? I repeat, will the real Slim Shady please stand up? We're gonna have a problem here Y'all act like you never seen a white person before Jaws all on the floor like Pam, like Tommy just burst in the door, and started whoopin' her ass worse than before They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture {Aww!} It's the return of the "Ah, wait, no way, you're kidding He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?" And Dr. Dre said... nothing, you idiots Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (ha, ha!) Feminist women love Eminem "Chicka, chicka, chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him Look at him, walking around grabbing his you-know-what Flipping the you-know-who," "Yeah, but he's so cute though" Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose But no worse than what's going on in your parents' bedrooms Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose "My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips" And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss And that's the message that we deliver to little kids And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is Of course they're gonna know what intercourse is By the time they hit fourth grade They've got the Discovery Channel, don't they? We ain't nothing but mammals -- well, some of us, cannibals Who cut other people open like cantaloupes But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes, then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up Please stand up, please stand up? I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up Please stand up, please stand up? Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records Well, I do, so fuck him and fuck you too You think I give a damn about a Grammy? Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me "But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?" Why, so you guys could just lie to get me here? So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears? Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first Little bitch put me on blast on MTV "Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee" I should download an audio on MP3 And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups All you do is annoy me so I have been sent here to destroy you And there's a million of us just like me Who cuss like me; who just don't give a fuck like me Who dress like me; walk, talk and act like me And just might be the next best thing, but not quite me I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up Please stand up, please stand up? I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up Please stand up, please stand up? I'm like a head trip to listen to Cause I'm only givin' you things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all And I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all I just get on the mic and spit it And whether you like to admit it I just shit it better than 90% of you rappers out can, then you wonder how can kids eat up these albums like Valiums It's funny, cause at the rate I'm going, when I'm 30 I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting Pinching nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working And every single person is a Slim Shady lurking He could be working at Burger King Spittin' on your onion rings Or in the parking lot, circling, screaming, "I don't give a fuck" With his windows down and his system up So will the real Shady please stand up And put one of those fingers on each hand up? And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go? I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up Please stand up, please stand up? I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up Please stand up, please stand up? I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up Please stand up, please stand up? I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up Please stand up, please stand up? Ha, ha, I guess theres a Slim Shady in all of us Fuck it, lets all stand up [Produced by Dr. Dre & Mel-Man] 
[Produced by Eminem] Man, whatever Dre, just let it run Ayo, turn the beat up a little bit Ayo, this song is for anyone Fuck it, just shut up and listen, ayo [Verse 1] I sit back with this pack of Zig-Zags and this bag Of this weed, it gives me the shit needed to be The most meanest MC on this on this Earth And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve all this tension Dispensing these sentences, getting this stress That's been eating me recently off of this chest And I rest again peacefully But at least have the decency in you To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out In the streets when I'm eating or feeding my daughter To not come and speak to me I don't know you, and no, I don't owe you a mothafuckin' thing I'm not Mr. N'Sync, I'm not what your friends think I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick if you tempt me My tank is on empty, no patience is in me And if you offend me, I'm lifting you ten feet in the air I don't care who was there and who saw me just jaw you Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe I'm tired of all you, I don't mean to be mean But that's all I can be, it's just me And I am whatever you say I am If I wasn't, then why would I say I am? In the paper, the news, every day I am Radio won't even play my jam Cause I am whatever you say I am If I wasn't, then why would I say I am? In the paper, the news, every day I am I don't know, it's just the way I am Sometimes I just feel like my father I hate to be bothered with all of this nonsense, it's constant And, "Oh, it's his lyrical content, the song 'Guilty Conscience' has gotten such rotten responses" And all of this controversy circles me And it seems like the media immediately points a finger at me So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinkie Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up With the bullshit they pull, cause they full of shit too When a dude's getting bullied and shoots up his school And they blame it on Marilyn and the heroin Where were the parents at? And look where it's at! Middle America, now it's a tragedy Now it's so sad to see, an upper-class city Havin' this happening Then attack Eminem cause I rap this way But I'm glad, cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire to burn and it's burning, and I have returned And I am whatever you say I am If I wasn't, then why would I say I am? In the paper, the news, every day I am Radio won't even play my jam Cause I am whatever you say I am If I wasn't, then why would I say I am? In the paper, the news, every day I am I don't know, it's just the way I am I'm so sick and tired of being admired That I wish that I would just die or get fired And dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables I'm not gonna be able to top on "My Name Is" And pigeon-holed into some poppy sensation To cop me rotation at rock-n-roll stations And I just do not got the patience To deal with these cocky Caucasians Who think I'm some wigger who just tries to be black Cause I talk with an accent, and grab on my balls So they always keep asking the same fucking questions What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in The why, the who, what, when, the where and the how Till I'm grabbing my hair and I'm tearin' it out Cause they driving me crazy, I can't take it I'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand and I sit And I'm thankful for every fan that I get But I can't take a shit in the bathroom Without someone standing by it No, I won't sign you an autograph You can call me an asshole, I'm glad, cause And I am whatever you say I am If I wasn't, then why would I say I am? In the paper, the news, every day I am Radio won't even play my jam Cause I am whatever you say I am If I wasn't, then why would I say I am? In the paper, the news, every day I am I don't know, it's just the way I am 
[Intro: Eminem] Cause sometimes you just feel tired, feel weak And when you feel weak, you feel like you wanna just give up But you gotta search within you And gotta find that inner strength And just pull that shit out of you And get that motivation to not give up And not be a quitter, no matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face, and collapse [Verse 1: Eminem] Till I collapse I'm spilling these raps long as you feel 'em Till the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killing 'em Cause when I am not, then I'ma stop penning 'em And I am not hip hop and I'm just not Eminem Subliminal thoughts, when I'ma stop sending 'em? Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop Amoxicillin's just not real enough The criminal cop killin', hip-hop villain A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners You're coming with me, feel it or not, you're gonna fear it Like I showed you the spirit of God lives in us You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzin' up? Fa shizzel, my wizzel, this is the plot, listen up You bizzels forgot, Slizzel does not give a fuck [Hook: Nate Dogg] Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse Music is like magic, there's a certain feeling you get When you real and you spit, and people are feeling your shit This is your moment, and every single minute you spend Tryna hold on to it because you may never get it again So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can And when your run is over, just admit when it's at its end Because I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in It goes Reggie, Jay-Z, 2Pac and Biggie Andre from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas, and then me But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does not offend me That's why you see me walk around Like nothing's bothering me Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me You hate it, but you know respect you got to give me The press's wet dream, like Bobby and Whitney; Nate, hit me [Hook: Nate Dogg] Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse [Verse 3: Eminem] Soon as a verse starts, I eat at an emcee's heart What is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart And it's absurd how people hang on every word I'll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothing could ever be worse That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict I rap like I'm addicted to smack, like I'm Kim Mathers But I don't want to go forth and back in constant battles The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers So this is like a full-blown attack I'm launching at 'em The track is on some battling raps, who want some static? Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters A plaque and platinum status is whack if I'm not the baddest [Hook: Nate Dogg] Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse [Outro: Eminem (Nate Dogg)] Until the roof (until the roof) The roof comes off (the roof comes off) Until my legs (until my legs) Give out from (underneath me) I will not fall, I will stand tall Feels like no one can beat me 
[Intro] Yeah, it's my life In my own words, I guess [Verse 1] Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for? Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for? When they know they're your heart And you know you were their armor And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her But what happens when karma, turns right around and bites you? And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you? What happens when you become the main source of a pain? "Daddy, look what I made!", Dad's gotta go catch a plane "Daddy, where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy, where is she?" I don't know, go play Hailie, baby, your Daddy's busy Daddy's writing a song, this song ain't gon' write itself I'll give you one underdog then you gotta swing by yourself Then turn right around on that song and tell her you love her And put hands on her mother who's a spitting image of her That's Slim Shady, yeah, baby, Slim Shady's crazy Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rocka-by-baby [Hook] And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling And I didn't feel a thing, so baby Don't feel no pain, just smile back And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling And I didn't feel a thing, so baby Don't feel no pain, just smile back [Verse 2] I keep having this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing She keeps screaming, she don't want me to sing "You're making Mommy cry, why? Why is Mommy cryin'?" Baby, Daddy ain't leaving no more, "Daddy you're lyin' You always say that, you always say this is the last time But you ain't leaving no more, Daddy, you're mine" She's piling boxes in front of the door, trying to block it "Daddy please, Daddy don't leave, Daddy no stop it!" Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket It's got a picture, "this'll keep you safe, Daddy, take it withcha" I look up, it's just me standing in the mirror These fuckin' walls must be talking, cause man, I can hear 'em They're saying "You've got one more chance to do right" and it's tonight Now go out there and show that you love 'em before it's too late And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door, it turns to a stage, they're gone, and this spotlight is on, and I'm singing [Hook] And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling And I didn't feel a thing, so baby Don't feel no pain, just smile back And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling And I didn't feel a thing, so baby Don't feel no pain, just smile back [Verse 3] Sixty thousand people, all jumping out their seat The curtain closes, they're throwing roses at my feet I take a bow and thank you all for coming out They're screaming so loud, I take one last look at the crowd I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seein' "Daddy it's me! Help Mommy, her wrists are bleedin'" But baby, we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden? "I followed you Daddy , you told me that you weren't leavin' "You lied to me, Dad, and now you make Mommy sad "And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad' "That's all I wanted, I just wanted to give you this coin" "I get the point fine, me and Mommy are goin'" But baby, wait, "It's too late, Dad, you made the choice. Now go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us That's what they want, they want you, Marshall, they keep screamin' your name. It's no wonder you can't go to sleep Just take another pill, yeah, I bet you you will You rap about it, yeah, word, k-keep it real" I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see How could it be, that the curtain is closing on me? I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it Put it to my brain, scream "Die, Shady!" and pop it The sky darkens, my life flashes. The plane that I was supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin' There's birds singin', it's Spring and Hailie's outside swingin' I walk right up to Kim and kiss her, tell her I miss her Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister, almost as if to [Hook] And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling And I didn't feel a thing, so baby Don't feel no pain, just smile back And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling And I didn't feel a thing, so baby Don't feel no pain, just smile back *Curtains Closing* 
[Hook: X Ambassadors] I'm getting by with my wicked ways I'm loading up and I'm taking names I wanna dig my way to hell I wanna dig my way to hell Guess I got a way with words, I could get away with murder Ever heard of Aspergers'?

[Produced by Hopsin] Check it, I used to be the goofy man you hounded The Special Ed kid at lunchtime the bitches wouldn't stand around with I would jack off so much back at my parents' house And now my dick has a permanent imprint of my hand around it Life was lame, I had to pay money to fuck a whore I couldn't pull a damn anorexic bitch in a tug o' war But then I made enough money for me to fund a tour Now the ladies show me the goodies under their wonderbra I'm going door to door, with foreign swords Causing more than war slaying rappers, commercial or horrorcore So hold your head cause I'mma torture yours, leaving morbid sores I promise you it will be hard to ignore the gore Hip hop's dead, and I'm the lucky savior I'm kinda mad and I don't wanna pile up the anger All these no-flow, gimmicky ass fired up behaviors With wack beats and gap teeth like Tyler the Creator Motherfucker, you not dope So you tryna get some attention by cussing and eating a fucking cockroach? And Goblin? You get no props on it It sucks so much I get blowjobs from it I been told you niggas, "I'm real!" If you wack and no one's confronted you on your bullshit, then I will Hate on me, but you can't deny skill I crush all the momentum that you guys build with my eyes sealed You faggots got me cussing And only reason you probably buzzing Is cause you slave as an Illuminati puppet Y'all really on one, beat it, you're gone, done You think real niggas feeling your shit? C'mon son! I'm the illest and that's fo' shizzle My flow sizzles, yo boy Hop go hard like some cold nipples You niggas are making it so simple My swag makes the ladies wave like fat stomachs with bold ripples I know you niggas wish you could prevent it Cause I get buck like my Kool Aid's got way too much sugar in it You better run like I'm booger flicking Homie I've been good at rapping, now I'm tryna get gooder with it So I'mma just go beast, and bring that West coast heat Cause I'll be damned if you flex on me The radio is filled with garbage over techno beats And all these songs about cash are what we just don't need Yo, nobody care about how much money you stack I murder everything I touch, buddy, move back Got enough guts to sew trash and bust up your fluke act And leave your fans saying, "How the fuck does he do that?" My ranking is vicious, you thinking it isn't? Come pay me a visit if you feel that you may be offended Baby I'm wicked, crazy and sick and with the face of a nimwit I be calling out names, but I ain't taking attendance Some bitch was like "Hop, you got me crying Cause you said I could call you while you out on tour Shit and I be trying, I even text you, but you not replying So when your new shit finally drop, that's one album I will not be buying What, You're too Hollywood? And you don't even have two minutes? Ever since you got your buzz, you don't know how bad you tripping You went to that ho's house last night and you said that you didn't I seen your pic on Facebook, the skank bitch done tagged you in it" I got put on with the beastie flow Now the sluts, they wanna bone when they see me, whoa! So I must, I take 'em home, let the wee wee grow Then I bust from different strokes like the TV show See when I be coming through kicking it raw, niggas like, "Gee, he's dope" If there's anyone throwing dirt at my name then you know he be toast For all of you rappers who bringing me drama, homie please be ghost The only reason I'm being aggressive is cause we need hope "Hey yo Hopsin, I fucking love you, cause you supply the best rhymes Since your flow is kinda strange, you should sign with Tech N9ne You design erect lines, who am I to just lie? Every single night I play your music right at bedtime And usually I'm not into dark dick I wanna do something freaky enough to win your heart with" I say, "What you wanna do?" She say, "It's simple, Marcus I wanna blow it before you put it in like a Nintendo cartridge" Bitch, I'm hotter than a UV ray Hotter than the thought of Nicki Minaj naked, making her booty shake Hot enough to pull up to your show and steal your groupie date Hot enough to melt the ice cream that's on Gucci's face And now you having hot flashes All the shit that you ever wanted in one MC, Hop has it Don't rap if you do not practice I cockblock wack shit, now get ready for Knock Madness 
Man I hate rap, but if the shoe fits, wear it I've become a freak of nature all the kids stare at Who walk around bumping RAW with the shit blaring Saying "fuck school" and dropping out like a miscarriage I'm embarrassed and I'm ashamed I played a part in this devilish game Making your common sense perish but I ain't taking the full blame Cause most of you chumps running around here ain't never had strict parents All of your brain cells rotting from weed You feeling like if you ain't got it, life's not as complete You having sex with every-motherfuckin'-body you see With a past so dark that Satan'd jump out of his seat But still you out in these streets thinking you hot as can be Without the knowledge to lead so you just follow the sheep Making sure your lame swag is all polished and clean While your favorite rapper's like "Yeah, he got it from me" You been brainwashed by a fake life that you're used to livin' When I say the word "fun", what do you envision? Probably drinking and smoking out with your crew And chilling with clueless women you trying to bang, bumping New Edition Is that all you think life really is Well if so, then you're a fucking idiot I honestly feel like grabbing your head and hitting it Matter of fact, you don't even deserve a brain; GIMME IT! Do you even have any goals Aside from bagging these hoes and packing a bowl Well let me guess- No You're only in school because your parents make you go When all you do is play beer pong and hang out with your bros Yo, society's got you living for a whack cause You're a fucking adult with no skills at all You don't read any books or play ball You don't draw, you literally do nothing at all Still you fiend for the glamorous fruits You don't have cause you idolize rappers that do And all they say is "I got money and it's stacked to the roof" And now you think that it's gon' magically just happen to you How? Your lazy ass don't commit to labor You pick something up, try it out, and put it down two minutes later Then you complain about your life cause it ain't getting catered Now whoever tries to call you on your bullshit's a hater You wanna succeed, you have to try Or one day you'll get older and regret it all cause you can't provide Your friends are lowlifes, don't act surprised Look, just cut the bad fruit off of the tree, make the sacrifice Girls, stop acting like you want a guy with traits like Romeo Bitch that's a fucking lie You always talk about how every man's fake And you can't take it and you want something real Shut up tramp, save it Twice a week you put on your makeup and damn bracelets And head to the club half-naked with your ass shaking Pulling a lowlife nigga who claim he cash making Till you let him hit and find out he work at the gas station One of them niggas got you pregnant and you can't raise it But you caused it, your actions made a fat statement You want Romeo, then act patient And stop fronting like he in the club posted in the back waitin' It's the club, where guys put on a new persona After they get loaded with a few coronas They always shouting and wild out with habits that very few condone of Then they look for beautiful brainless bitches like you to bone 'em Then when they leave you, you cry and cry Talking 'bout, "Oh my god I can't find a guy I've spent so many years and I've tried and tried Why am I even on Earth? I should die" You want Romeo, you're not worthy You're cock-thirsty You're nasty and probably got herpes Sometimes the secret to finding is to stop searching Try a new formula, cause your last one's not working The term "real nigga"'s publicly used And I need to know what it means, cause I'm fucking confused Are you one for always busting your tool With nothing to lose and something to prove to homies up in your crew Is it because you're selling drugs to get loot And brag about how you done been shot and stabbed Like it's fun to be you But your life's a struggle, right, and you just hustling through Nah, you hamster ass nigga, you just stuck in a loop Man, why do black people gotta be the only ones who can't evolve Cause you in the streets acting like a neanderthal It's clear you can't stand the law, you're lost as an abandoned dog And all you're interested in is fighting, rapping, and basketball I can't even fuck with you, cause if we out in public You gon' get caught stealing some shit and get my ass in trouble, too You'll get old and be nothing Living life in these streets, thugging and starting shit with anybody mean mugging Look at you, a real nigga, thinking your life's cool Girls used to turn me down for guys who were like you Till you grab their heart and shove a spearhead right through Then they regret it because it wasn't the right move Your real nigga talk seems bogus A real nigga don't brag about being real as long as he knows it And his future doesn't seem hopeless A real nigga stays out of jail, handles shit, and he keeps focused To all you rappers whose soul is out in the wrong You inspired the issue I wrote about in this song You go to prowl on the young who roam around in the slums See this is what happens when rap's overcrowded with bums Hope the hour's long when I'm rolling out with your tongue The man above is my guide, you know the power is strong All you menacing freaks are only in it for cheese And the mass control limit was breached - fuck hip-hop They only in it for cheese, and any eyewitness can see They purposely making the innocent weak My existence on this planet's for you, I ain't only here to benefit me Yo, we need to make a change while there's still time It is hard, and sometimes I struggle trying to reveal mine I can guide you if you feel blind I just need you to be willing to journey into my ill mind 
[Produced By: Hopsin] It's us, find power Live life, mind power It's us, find power Live life, mind power Yo, fuck anybody I might alarm Life is a tour, I sit and ride along Taking some notes and then I write the song Im staring down the road my life has gone Is this where I belong? Is it wrong to not believe in right and wrong? My mental state is fucking me up And I cry the pond while asking you for some answers But we dont have that type of bond That my desires gone with the way that Ive been living lately If I died right now, youd turn the fire on Sick of this bullshit, niggas call me a sellout Cause I hopped on Christianity so strongly then I fell out Now Im avoiding questions like a scared dog with his tail down Feeling so damn humiliated because they looking at me like Im hellbound What story should I tell now? Ill just expose the truth I'm so close to the fucking edge, I should be close to you But who the fuck are You? You never showed the proof And Im only fucking human yo, what am I supposed to do? Theres way too many different religions with vivid descriptions Begging all fucking men and women to listen I cant even beat my dick without getting convicted These aint wicked decisions, I got different intentions I've been itching to get it, Ive been given assistance But the whole fucking system is twisted Now Im dealing with this backlash because Marcus isn't a Christian And Ive been told that my sinful life is an addiction But I cant buy it, its just too hard to stand beside it I need an answer and humans cant provide it I look at the Earth and Sun and I can tell a genius man designed it Its truly mind blowing, I cant deny it Is heaven real? Is it fake? Is it really how I fantasize it? Wheres the Holy Ghost at? How longs it take a man to find it? My minds a nonstop tape playing and I cant rewind it You gave me a Bible and expect me not to analyze it? Im frustrated and you provoked it Im not reading that motherfucking book because a human wrote it I have a fucking brain, you should know it You gave it to me to think to avoid every useless moment It was a mission that I had to abort Cause humans be lying, we're such an inaccurate source Its gon be hard to put me back on the course Next Jehovahs Witness to come on my porch I swear Im slammin the door A lot of folks believe it though, but Im not surprised Humans are fucking dumb, still thinking that Pacs alive I aint trying to take your legacy and torch it down Im just saying: I aint heard shit from the horses mouth Just sheep always telling stories of older guys Who were notarized by you when you finally vocalized Now Im supposed to bow my head and close my eyes And somehow let the Holy Ghost arise Sounds like a fucking Poltergeist Show yourself and then boom it's done Every rumors gone, I no longer doubt this shit, youre the One Ill admit that my sinful ways was stupid fun And all my old habits can hop on top of a roof to plunge Ill donate to a charity that could use the funds Fuck the club, instead of bitches Id hang with a group of nuns And everyone that I ran into would know what I came to do I wouldn't take a step unless it was in the name of You I hate the fact that I have to believe You havent been chatting with me like you did Adam and Eve And I aint seen no fucking talking snake unravel from trees With an apple to eat, that shit never happens to me I dont know if you do or dont exist, it is driving me crazy Send your condolences, this is me reaching to you so dont forget If hell is truly your pit of fire and I get thrown in it Imma probably regret the fact that I ever wrote this shit My gut feeling says its all fake I hate to say it but fuck it, shit I done lost faith This isnt a small phase, my perspectives all changed My thoughts just keep picking shit apart all day And in my mind I make perfect sense If you arent real then all my prayers arent worth a cent That would mean that I could just make up what my purpose is And I could sit in church and say fuck in the services Man what if Jesus was a facade? Then that would mean the governments god I feel like theyve been brainwashing us with a lot So much that we dont even notice that were stuck in the box Man everything is what if?, why is it always what if? Planet Earth what if?, the universe what if? My sacrifice what if!, my afterlife what if! Every fucking thing that deals with you is fucking suspect Im fucking done, Im fucking done This is my fucking life and Im living it, Im having fun If you really care for me, prove that I need to live carefully But Ill be damned if I put my own pleasure aside for an afterlife that isnt even guaranteed We are you, and youre us, stop playing games My lifes all I got, and heaven is all in my brain And when I feel I am in hell, my ideas are what get me through pain Do as you please, and Ill just do me Im a human, Ill stay in my lane Ill mind It's us, find power Live life, mind power It's us, find power Live life, mind power 
[Intro] You think you original? You ain't original You were programmed to be you You're a slave and you don't even know it The shit you think of ain't even your thoughts Let's step out the box for a minute [Verse 1] How do we know if God exists? How do we know what's positive? Are you the definition of an angel or the opposite? If you lost your wallet and I found it, I would not commit To stealing it, but if the tables turned then you would pocket it See, I been me for so long, but I still don't know who Hopsin is How come I'm the one My teachers used to have a problem with? I show my music to different labels, they ain't too fond of it But in the underground I seem to get so many compliments Say my name and it's like people get afraid and shook But if you take a look, you'll see I'm nothing like an angry crook I'm learning hands-on, you busy with your face in books I'm here to benefit the world So Heaven's where we're safely put I'm not a devil, not speakin' in tongues I just wanna touch your heart, I try to reach it in songs I'm from where a child's future's on the streets with the bums Because it's hard to become Something so unique where I'm from When the sun's down Nocturnal rainbows soar in the air so high It may seem so that I can't see But the darkness provides the light for me I don't wanna be lonely And the moon is my only homie If there's a higher power then show me Instead of nocturnal rainbows [Verse 2] Obama's president, so? What's he represent? Just because the nigga's half black don't mean he's Heaven-sent You're clueless to evidence and all the minds he's messin' with His charm and smile hasn't got my ass up out this debt for shit Frontin' like he's truly Jesus It's like we all broker than ever, it's due to reasons Dealing with self-beneficial plans and the movement he's with Illuminati, or whatever the fuck they go by They're the reason weird shit happens and we don't know why Why did Michael Jackson start his tour then have to go die? How did rap music go from really good to so dry? Real artists get shelved and wack one's get famous To leave masses brainless, a smart mind is dangerous In their eyes there probably ain't no real shit in your playlist You're just a product of what the government has created When the sun's down Nocturnal rainbows soar in the air so high It may seem so that I can't see But the darkness provides the light for me I don't wanna be lonely And the moon is my only homie If there's a higher power then show me Instead of nocturnal rainbows [Verse 3] We're all smart and we know what's bad and good for us But yet when you got offered some marijuana, you took a puff Your brain's a fucking powerhouse But what, that wasn't good enough? It's people like you who talk that shoulda-coulda-woulda stuff You probably threw your life away Cause you would rather get high With no license or car, so you bum rides to get by Saying "I should've did this" Or "I shouldn't have hung with this guy" "I'm broke as fuck, my rent's high. Ah, I should've realized." I ain't being cruel, with these situations that I address I more than likely could be someone you admire, yes But it's because the blood, sweat and all the time that I invest We play the same game Difference is you never try your best You don't have a skill, you set yourself up for a higher mess I work around the clock, you slack off for lots of time to rest Keep bullshittin' till your life is gone Cause living's naturally hell You have to work to put a smile on When the sun's down Nocturnal rainbows soar in the air so high It may seem so that I can't see But the darkness provides the light for me I don't wanna be lonely And the moon is my only homie If there's a higher power then show me Instead of nocturnal rainbows 
Intro Yeah, Hopsin, funk volume Come on, keep sleepin' on me Hollywood ass rappers, bitch ass females Huh, That's enough to make a nigga flip I erupt like a bomb so give up the baton I'll slap you after bustin' a fuckin' nut in my palm Why you muggin' me like something was wrong? Just take a puff of the bong And let me leave your mind corrupt from the song See you can't stop me, cuz I'mma brainwash teens And create false dreams cuz it pays off clean I'm just an idiotic, ironic, symbolic, Illuminati product That's gonna be killed if I talk about it (shhh) This industry business is all screwed up I have no favorite rappers because all you suck! I sever the weakest niggas who not on my pedigree Cuz on a tombstone is as hard as their name will ever be I'm judged by my wild image a lot And everybody seems to think I have a sinister plot I do! Be offended by every sentence I jot I got some militant thoughts, and you ain't killin' 'em off! So listen I sag my pants until my ass shows I even slap hoes (Bitch) Yeah, I'm an asshole Yeah, yeah And your parents hate me 'cuz I love you (So?) Tell 'em I said "Fuck you!" Yeah I said "Fuck You!" Yeah, yeah I snuck in Drake's house when he was alone inside You can say I have a bogus mind I dimmed the lights down and closed the blinds Around his neck is where my rope was tied I yanked on it 'till it broke his spine Yeah! Lately I been fucking pissed off (Why?) 'Cuz everybody sayin' Lil Wayne spits raw I'll start a big brawl, and slam his ass into a brick wall And have a fat nigga sit on him, Rick Ross Boss! I don't play with this rap shit I got no life, I stay in the attic Fuck a rap career, I'm waiting to smash it Soulja Boy yougot a corny flow So you can suck my fucking dick through a glory hole I'm just being me, what you tryna hate for? All you niggas is faker than Lupe Fiasco claiming he skateboards Yeah right, that nigga can't even ollie Push him away on the dolly not even Satan can stop me! I'm probably the sickest motherfucker who don't get recognized Eazy-E's wife's life somewhere now jeopardized She signed me and I was set aside For like 3 and a half years, I don't think I remember why I'm fucking dope and this is my reward? That's wacker than the 500 dollars you signed me for! Eazy's dead now, yeah the label's finally yours Too bad he never knew that you were just a grimy whore! You can't maintain what Eric built I know he's in his grave turning like a ferris wheel Don't think you cool just cuz you inherit mills Bitch bare the skills I'm Hopsin, I spit shit so unfair and real I got some deep, dark issues within All because you lied and tried to pretend you a friend Fuck Ruthless! Bitch, I'll never lend you a hand! And I'mma make sure nobody ever sign with you again! You know why? 
[Produced by DJ Pooh] [Verse 1] Just waking up in the morning, gotta thank God I don't know but today seems kinda odd No barking from the dog, no smog And momma cooked a breakfast with no hog I got my grub on, but didn't pig out Finally got a call from a girl I wanna dig out Hooked it up for later as I hit the door Thinking will I live another 24 I gotta go cause I got me a drop-top And if I hit the switch, I can make the ass drop Had to stop at a red light Looking in my mirror and not a jacker in sight And everything is alright I got a beep from Kim, and she can fuck all night Called up the homies and I'm asking y'all "Which park are y'all playing basketball?" Get me on the court and I'm trouble Last week fucked around and got a triple double Freaking niggas every way like MJ I can't believe today was a good day Drove to the pad and hit the showers Didn't even get no static from the cowards Cause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me Saw the police and they rolled right past me No flexing, didn't even look in a nigga's direction As I ran the intersection Went to Short Dog's house, they was watching "Yo! MTV Raps" What's the haps on the craps? Shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em Roll 'em in a circle of niggas and watch me break 'em With the 7, 7-11, 7-11 7 even back door Lil Joe I picked up the cash flow Then we played bones, and I'm yelling domino Plus nobody I know got killed in South Central LA Today was a good day Left my nigga's house paid Picked up a girl been tryna fuck since the 12th grade It's ironic, I had the brew she had the chronic The Lakers beat the Supersonics I felt on the big fat fanny Pulled out the jammy and killed the punani And my dick runs deep, so deep So deep put her ass to sleep Woke her up around one She didn't hesitate to call Ice Cube the top gun Drove her to the pad and I'm coasting Took another sip of the potion, hit the 3-wheel motion I was glad everything had worked out Dropped her ass off and then chirped out Today was like one of those fly dreams Didn't even see a berry flashing those high beams No helicopter looking for a murder 2 in the morning, got the Fatburger Even saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp And it read "Ice Cube's a Pimp" Drunk as hell but no throwing up Half way home and my pager still blowing up Today I didn't even have to use my AK I got to say it was a good day [Outro] Hey wait, wait a minute Pooh, stop this shit.

I once knew a nigga whose real name was William His primary concern was making a million Being the illest hustler that the world ever seen He used to fuck movie stars and sniff coke in his dreams A corrupted young mind at the age of thirteen Nigga never had a father and his mom was a fiend She put the pipe down, but for every year she was sober Her son's heart simultaneously grew colder He started hanging out selling bags in the projects Checking the young chicks, looking for hit and run prospects He was fascinated by material objects But he understood money never bought respect He built a reputation cause he could hustle and steal But got locked once and didn't hesitate to squeal So criminals he chilled with didn't think he was real You see, me and niggas like this have never been equal I don't project my insecurities in other people He fiended for props like addicts with pipes and needles So he felt he had to prove to everyone he was evil A feeble-minded young man with infinite potential The product of a ghetto-bred capitalistic mental Coincidentally dropped out of school to sell weed Dancing with the devil, smoked until his eyes would bleed But he was sick of selling trees and gave in to his greed Everyone trying to be trife never face the consequences You probably only did a month for minor offenses Ask a nigga doing life if he had another chance But then again there's always the wicked that knew in advance Dance forever with the devil on a cold cell block But that's what happens when you rape, murder and sell rock Devils used to be God's angels that fell from the top There's no diversity because we're burning in the melting pot So Billy started robbing niggas, anything he could do To get his respect back in the eyes of his crew Starting fights over little shit up on the block Stepped up to selling mothers and brothers the crack rock Working overtime for making money for the crack spot Hit the jackpot and wanted to move up to cocaine Fulfilling the Scarface fantasy stuck in his brain Tired of the block niggas treating him the same He wanted to be major like the cut throats and the thugs But when he tried to step to 'em, niggas showed him no love They told him any motherfucking coward can sell drugs Any bitch nigga with a gun can bust slugs Any nigga with a red shirt can front like a blood Even Puffy smoked the motherfucker up in a club But only a real thug can stab someone 'til they die Standing in front of them, staring straight into their eyes Billy realized that these men were well guarded And they wanted to test him before business started Suggested raping a bitch to prove he was cold hearted So now he had a choice between going back to his life Or making money with made men up in the cyph' His dreams about cars and ice made him agree A hardcore nigga is all he ever wanted to be And so he met them Friday night at a quarter to three Everyone trying to be trife never face the consequences You probably only did a month for minor offenses Ask a nigga doing life if he had another chance But then again there's always the wicked that knew in advance Dance forever with the devil on a cold cell block But that's what happens when you rape, murder and sell rock Devils used to be God's angels that fell from the top There's no diversity because we're burning in the melting pot They drove around the projects slow while it was raining Smoking blunts, drinking and joking for entertainment Until they saw a woman on the street walking alone Three in the morning, coming back from work, on her way home And so they quietly got out the car and followed her Walking through the projects, the darkness swallowed her They wrapped her shirt around her head and knocked her onto the floor "This is it, kid, now you got your chance to be raw" So Billy yoked her up and grabbed the chick by the hair And dragged her into a lobby that had nobody there She struggled hard, but they forced her to go up the stairs They got to the roof and then held her down on the ground Screaming "Shut the fuck up and stop moving around" The shirt covered her face, but she screamed and clawed So Billy stomped on the bitch until he had broken her jaw The dirty bastards knew exactly what they were doing They kicked her until they cracked her ribs and she stopped moving Blood leaking through the cloth, she cried silently And then they all proceeded to rape her violently Billy was made to go first, but each of them took a turn Ripping her up and choking her until her throat burned Her broken jaw mumbled for God, but they weren't concerned When they were done and she was lying bloody, broken and bruised One of them niggas pulled out a brand new twenty-two They told him that she was a witness of what she'd gone through And if he killed her, he was guaranteed a spot in the crew He thought about it for a minute, she was practically dead And so he leaned over and put the gun right to her head [Sample] I'm falling and I can't turn back I'm falling and I can't turn back Right before he pulled the trigger and ended her life He thought about the cocaine with the platinum and ice And he felt strong standing along with his new brothers Cocked the gat to her head and pulled back the shirt cover But what he saw made him start to cringe and stutter Cause he was staring into the eyes of his own mother She looked back at him and cried, cause he had forsaken her She cried more painfully than when they were raping her His whole world stopped, he couldn't even contemplate His corruption had successfully changed his fate And he remembered how his mom used to come home late Working hard for nothing, cause now what was he worth? He turned away from the woman that had once given him birth And crying out to the sky cause he was lonely and scared But only the devil responded, cause God wasn't there And right then, he knew what it was to be empty and cold And so he jumped off the roof and died with no soul They say death takes you to a better place, but I doubt it After that, they killed his mother, and never spoke about it And listen, cause the story that I'm telling is true Cuz I was there with Billy Jacobs, and I raped his mom, too And now the devil follows me everywhere that I go In fact, I'm sure he's standing among one of you at my shows And every street cypher listening to little thugs flow He could be standing right next to you, and you wouldn't know The devil grows inside the hearts of the selfish and wicked White, brown, yellow and black; color is not restricted You have a self destructive destiny when you're inflicted And you'll be one of God's children that fell from the top There's no diversity because we're burning in the melting pot So when the devil wants to dance with you, you better say never Because the dance with the devil might last you forever [Intro: Immortal Technique] Oh y'all motherfuckers thought it was over, huh? Well its not You didnt count on a fallen angel getting back into the grace of god and coming after you Yall niggas aint shit Your producers aint shit. Your fuckin' A & R aint shit Your worship defeat the purpose Like President Bush takin' bullets for the secret service Show no compassion like havin a straight-faced orgasm Have his half-a-ten bitch suck my friends dick In the mean time, you can french kiss this clenched fist Diabolic A one-man brigade spreading cancer plague Fist fuckin a pussys face Holdin' a hand grenade I just had to get that stress off my chest like breast reduction Youre faker than blue-eyed crackers nailed to a crucifix Im 'bout to blow up like NASA Challenger computer chips Arsenic language transmitted revolutionarily Im like time itself, Im gonna kill you inevitably Chemically bomb you, fuck usin a chrome piece Im illmatic, you wont make it home like Jeromes niece Ill sever your head diagonally for thinkin' of dissin' me And then use your dead body to write my name in calligraphy So youre nothing, like diversity without equality Produces more digits than 22 divided by 7 Youre like Kevin Spacey, your style is usually suspect You never killed a cop, you not a motherfuckin' thug yet Face it, youre too basic Youre never gonna make it Like children walking through Antarctica, butt naked

Aye who am I?(Yeah) Things change, rearrange and so do I It ain't always for the better, dawg, I can't lie I get high cause the lows can be so cold I might bend a little bit but I don't fold One time for my mind and two for yours I got food for your thoughts to soothe your soul If you see my tears fall just let me be Move along, nothing to see [Verse 2] I always did shit the hard way My nigga Squirrel slangin' in the hallway Burnt CD's and trees like this was Broadway Times Square, kept the dimes there in the locker Some Reggie Miller With more brown hairs than Chewbacca Whispers that he got it for the low low, sell a Dime for a dub, them white boys ain't know no better Besides, what's twenty dollars to a nigga like that? He tell his pops he need some lunch And he gon' get it right back I peep game Got home snatched my mama keychain Took her whip, the appeal, too ill to refrain I hit the boulevard pull up to my nigga front do' His mama at home, she still let em' hit the blunt though I told her hello, and sat with my nigga and laughed And talked about how we gon' smash all the bitches in class I complimented how I see him out here getting his cash And just asked, "What a nigga gotta do to get that? Put me on," he just laughed when he seen I was sure 17 years breathing his demeanor said more He told me, "Nigga, you know how you sound right now? If you wasnt my mans I would think that you a clown right now Listen, you everything I wanna be that's why I fucks with you So how you looking up to me when I look up to you? You bout to go get a degree, I'ma be stuck with two choices: Either graduate to weight or selling number two For what? A hundred bucks or two a week? Do you think that you would know what to do if you was me? I got, four brothers, one mother that don't love us If they ain't want us why the fuck they never wore rubbers?" I felt ashamed to have ever complained about my lack of gear And thought about how far we done came From trailer park to a front yard with trees in the sky Thank you mama, dry your eyes, there ain't no reason to cry You made a genius and I, ain't gon' take it for granted I ain't gon' settle for lesser, I ain't gon' take what they handed Nah, I'm gon' take what they owe me And show you that I can fly And show old girl what she missing, the illest nigga alive Aye who am I? Things change, rearrange and so do I (Aye who am I?) It ain't always for the better, dawg, I can't lie (Who am I?) I get high cause the lows can be so cold I might bend a little bit but I don't fold One time for my mind and two for yours I got food for your thoughts to soothe your soul If you see my tears fall just let me be Move along, nothing to see I never felt better

Spinning in circles, live my life without rehearsals If I died today my nigga was it business? Was it personal? Should this be my last breath I'm blessed cause it was purposeful Never got to church to worship lord but please be merciful You made me versatile, well-rounded like cursive Know you chose me for a purpose, I put my soul in these verses Born sinner, was never born to be perfect Sucker for women licking they lips and holding these purses Back when we ran the streets who would think we grow to be murderers Teachers treated niggas as if they totally worthless And violent, and hopeless I saw but never noticed that a college point is right to "Be all that you can be" posters Rest in peace to Tiffany I don't know if this is the realest shit I wrote But know the realest nigga wrote this And signed it, and sealed it in a envelope and knew one day you'll find it And knew one day that you'd come back and rewind it, singing... [Hook: James Fauntleroy] I'm a born sinner But I'll die better than that, I swear You always where I needed you to be Whether you were there or not there (I was there) I was born sinning But I live better than that (better tonight) If you aint fucking with that I dont care (yeah, yeah, yeah) [Verse 2: J. Cole] Yeah, this music shit is a gift But God help us make it cause this music business is a cliff I got her life in my grip, she holding tight to my wrist She screaming: "Don't let me slip" She see the tears in my eyes, I see the fear on her lips True when I told you: "You the only reason why I don't flip and go insane" My roof in the pouring rain You knew me before the fame, don't lose me the more I change, no Just grow with me, go broke you go broke with me I smoke you gon' smoke with me Woman's curse since birth, man lead her to the hearse I go Bobby you go Whitney damn Listen here, I'll tell you my biggest fears You the only one who knows 'em Don't you ever go expose 'em This life is harder than you'll probably ever know Emotions I hardly ever show More for you than for me Don't you worry yourself I gotta do this for me They tell me life is a test but where's the tutor for me Pops came late I'm already stuck in my ways Ducking calls from my mother for days Sometimes she hate the way she raised me but she love what she raised Can't wait to hand her these house keys with nothing to say Except I'm a born sinner But I'll die better than that, I swear You always where I needed you to be Whether you were there or not there (I was there) I was born sinning But I live better than that (better tonight) If you aint fucking with that I dont care (yeah, yeah, yeah)

History repeats itself and that's just how it goes Same way that these rappers always bite each others flows Same thing that my nigga Elvis did with Rock n Roll Justin Timberlake, Eminem and then Macklemore While silly niggas argue over who gon' snatch the crown Look around, my nigga, white people have snatched the sound This year Ill prolly go to the awards dappered down Watch Iggy win a Grammy as I try to crack a smile I'm just playin', but all good jokes contain true shit Same rope you climb up on, they'll hang you with But not Jermaine, my aim too sick I bang nigga, I came to bring the pain my brain too quick You see how I maneuver this game, I ain't stupid I recognize that life is a dream, and I dream lucid And break the chains and change minds One verse at a time, and claim 2-6 And fuck it, if the shoe fits, who's the king? [Outro] We all kings (We all kings nigga) Kings of ourselves first and foremost (True) While the people debate who's the king of this rap game Here comes lil' ol' Jermaine With every ounce of strength in his veins To snatch the crown from whoever y'all think has it But rather than place it on his head as soon as he grabs it Poof, boom, paow, it's like magic With a flash and a BANG the crown disintegrates And falls to the Earth from which it came It's done Ain't gonna be no more kings Be wary of any man that claims Because deep down he clings onto the need for power The reality, he's a coward Ultimately he's scared to die And sometimes so am I But when I'm in tune with the most high I realize, the fear lies in my lack of awareness of the other side Today I know that we are the same, are the same, you and I Different kind of skin, different set of eyes Two different minds, but only one God (It's only one God nigga) It's for all the kings Cause I know deep down every poet just wanna be loved

I'm earnin' stripes now a nigga got Adidas galore Backstage I shook his hand, let 'em know that he's the man When he said he was a fan it was too hard to understand No time to soak up the moment though, cause I was in a jam Hov askin' where's the record that the radio could play And I was striking out for months, 9th inning feeling fear Jeter under pressure, made the biggest hit of my career But at first, that wasn't clear, niggas had no idea Dion called me when it dropped, sounded sad but sincere Told me Nas heard your single and he hate that shit Said you the one, yo why you make that shit  [Hook] I can't believe I let Nas down Damn, my heart sunk to my stomach, I can't believe I let Nas down I got defensive on the phone, resentment was in my tone, fuck it Long live the idols, may they never be your rivals Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible Now what you're 'bout to hear's a tale of glory and sin No I.D. my mentor now let the story begin [Verse 2] I couldn't help but think that maybe I had made a mistake I mean, you made "You Owe Me" dog, I thought that you could relate But while I shot up the charts You mean telling me that I was not up to par When I followed my heart Granted, my heart was tainted by my mind that kept on saying "Where's the hits?" You ain't got none You know Jay a never put your album out without none And dog, you know how come Labels are archaic, formulaic with they outcome They don't know, they just study the charts Me, I studied the shows, the fans, study they hearts I had a feelin' I was killin', and this music we were spillin' out Would change lives forever, fuck the label, put it out Friday Night Lights blew, that was classic number 2 Now it seemed as if the Nas comparisons was coming true Still no release date from the label, are they insane Gucc told me play the game to change the game But on the way I let Nas down I got no one to blame I'm a shame, I let Nas down But this is God's plan, you can never understand, fuck it Long live the idols, may they never be your rivals Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible Now what you're 'bout to hear's a tale of glory and sin No I.D. my mentor now let the story begin [Verse 3] I always believed in the bigger picture If I could get them niggas to listen outside my core then I can open up doors Reintroduce them to honesty, show 'em that they need more The difference between the pretenders and the Kendrick Lamars And so, I took the fall Like the son of the Lord on the cross Dying for that fake shit you niggas bought For the past decade If I should pass please let this be my last essay Therefore I write from the heart Apologies to OG's for sacrificing my art But I'm here for a greater purpose, I knew right from the start I'm just a man of the people, not above but equal And for the greater good I walk amongst the evil Don't cry mama, this the life I choose myself Just pray along the way that I don't lose myself This is for the nigga that said that Hip-Hop was dead I went to Hell to resurrect it, how could you fail to respect it Letting Nas down I got the phone call, quietly I mourned dog I let Nas down Yeah, and on this flight may I never lose sight, fuck it Long live the idols, may they never be your rivals Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible Now what you're 'bout to hear's a tale of glory and sin No I.D. my mentor now let the story begin 
Yeah, I had this little bad thing, something like them tens She gave a nigga mad brain, something like The Wiz But, you see, the sad thing fuckin' with her is Is the chick ain't even have brains, dummy like a bitch So I tried to show her about the world And about just who we really are And where we've come and how we still have to go really far Like, "Baby, look at how we live broke on the boulevard" But all she ever want me to do is unhook her bra Then all I really want is for her to go down low Before you know it, she wet enough to get drowned slow And all that deep shit I was previously down fo' Replaced by freak shit I am currently down fo' You see I peeped it, pussy is power That proud feeling we get knowing that pussy is ours And how it feels to feel that feeling You feeling when you be drillin' that shit Got her sayin' you be killin' that shit And all the pain the world cause, she be healin' that shit And naw, that ain't your girl, dog But you be feelin' that chick And you just wanna tell her everything she might need But in the meantime it's lights please Lights please, lights please, turn off the lights For now everything just seems so right And how you make the darkness seem so bright I'm feeling like things gon' be alright [Verse 2: J. Cole] So now we in the hotel, mirrors on the ceiling She say she wanna blow L's, I hear her and I'm willing But every time I smoke, well, a nigga mind gone So that every word I spoke, well, I'm tryin' to put her on But she couldn't hear me I told her all about how we been livin' a lie And that they love to see us all go to prison or die Like, "Baby, look at how they show us on the TV screen" But all she ever want me to do is unzip her jeans Then all I really want is for her to get on top Before you know it, she workin', jerkin' it nonstop And all that next shit I was previously talkin' Is now that wet shit that I'm currently lost in And while that sweat drip, I am reminded All the times my brother told me that pussy is blindin' I'm findin', the more I grow The more y'all seem to stay the same Don't even know the rules, but yet y'all tryin' to play the game And ain't it shameful how niggas blame hoes for givin' birth To a baby that took two to make? Coward nigga, you a fake How you gonna look in your son's face and turn your back Then go start another family? Dawg, what type of shit is that? She said it's okay, rub my head and told me to relax Laid a nigga down proper, like she was recording tracks Said "I know you wanna change the world But for the night, please Just reach over and hit the lights please" Lights please, lights please, turn off the lights For now everything just seems so right And how you make the darkness seem so bright I'm feeling like things gon' be alright Alright, if y'all niggas heard the first one, The Come Up and shit, then you would have heard part 1 of this joint right here. It's "Dead Presidents", you know classic nigga, that's classic Jay shit. So I did it, threw it on the first mixtape, this is about a year ago. We let niggas hear like you know the mixtape whatever, and there was always this one nigga that stuck out to me like a year ago. This nigga's like "yo". like I thought I did my thing on this shit, that was like two of my favorite verses that I did, but he was just like "Yo", like, "Yo you didn't come right man. If you gon' come on Dead Presidents son, you gotta come hard son, you gotta come harder than that son, you gotta come harder than that." I was like, man what you mean I came hard? But, that shit always stuck in my mind, so doing this next, you know, doing this The Warm Up I was like, damn, I gotta get on it again, I gotta do it again.

[Verse 1: Jay Z] Motherfuckers say that I'm foolish, I only talk about jewels Do you fools listen to music or do you just skim through it? See, I'm influenced by the ghetto you ruined That same dude you gave nothing, I made something doin' What I do, through and through, and I give you the news with a twist It's just his ghetto point of view The renegade, you been afraid, I penetrate pop culture Bring 'em a lot closer to the block where they pop toasters And they live with they moms, got dropped roadsters From botched robberies, niggas crouched over Mami's knocked up cause she wasn't watched over Knocked down by some clown When child support knocked; no, he's not around Now, how that sound to ya? Jot it down I bring it through the ghetto without riding round Hiding down, ducking strays From frustrated youths stuck in they ways Just read a magazine that fucked up my day How you rate music that thugs with nothing relate to it? I help them see they way through it not you Can't step in my pants, can't walk in my shoes Bet everything you're worth, you'll lose your tie and your shirt [Verse 2: Eminem] Since I'm in a position to talk to these kids and they listen I ain't no politician, but I'll kick it with 'em a minute Cause, see, they call me a menace And if the shoe fits I'll wear it But if it don't, then y'all will swallow the truth, grin and bear it Now, who's the king of these rude, ludicrous, lucrative lyrics? Who could inherit the title, put the youth in hysterics Usin' his music to steer it, sharin' his views and his merits? But there's a huge interference They're saying you shouldn't hear it Maybe it's hatred I spew, maybe it's food for the spirit Maybe it's beautiful music I made for you to just cherish But I'm debated, disputed, hated And viewed in America as a motherfuckin' drug addict Like you didn't experiment, nah nah That's when you start to stare at who's in the mirror And see yourself as a kid again, and you get embarrassed And I got nothing to do but make you look stupid as parents You fucking do-gooders Too bad you couldn't do good at marriage And do you have any clue what I had to do to get here? I don't think you do So stay tuned and keep your ears glued to the stereo Cause here we go, he's {*Jigga j-Jigga*} And I'm the sinister Mr. Kiss-My-Ass, it's just a Renegade! Never been afraid to say What's on my mind at any given time of day Cause I'm a (renegade!) never been afraid to talk About anything, (anything?), anything, (anything!) Renegade, (never been afraid to say What's on my mind at any given time of day Cause I'm a) renegade! (Never been afraid to holler About anything), anything? (Anything), anything! I had to hustle, my back to the wall, ashy knuckles Pockets filled with a lot of lint, not a cent Gotta vent, lot of innocent lives lost on the project bench Whatchu hollerin'? Gotta pay rent, bring dollars in By the bodega, iron under my coat, feeling braver Durag wrapping my waves up, pockets full of hope Do not step to me, I'm awkward, I box lefty An orphan my pops left me And often, my momma wasn't home Could not stress to me, I wasn't grown Especially on nights I brought something home To quiet the stomach rumblings My demeanor, 30 years my senior My childhood didn't mean much, only raising green up Raising my fingers to critics Raising my head to the sky, B.I.G. I did it, multi before I die No lie, just know I chose my own fate I drove by the fork in the road and went straight [Verse 4: Eminem] See, I'm a poet to some, a regular modern-day Shakespeare Jesus Christ, the King of these Latter-Day Saints here To shatter the picture in which of that as they paint me as A monger of hate, satanist, scatter-brained atheist But that ain't the case, see, it's a matter of taste We as a people decide if Shady's as bad as they say he is Or is he the latter, a gateway to escape? Media scapegoat, who they can be mad at today See, it's easy as cake, simple as whistling Dixie While I'm waving the pistol at sixty Christians against me Go to war with the Mormons, take a bath with the Catholics In holy water, no wonder they tried to hold me under longer I'm a motherfucking spiteful, delightful eyeful The new Ice Cube, motherfuckers hate to like you What did I do?

I had my demo with me. You know, like I always do. I play the songs, he's like "Who that spittin?" I'm like "It's me." He's like "Oh, well okay." this other kid Just Blaze [So won't you raise your glass won't you x4] my mentor, No ID And No ID told him, "Look man, you wanna mess with Kanye you need to tell him that you like the way he rap"  [No ID: "Yo, you wanna sign him, tell him you like how he rap"] [Saxophone Solo] I was all, I dunno if he was gassin' me or not but he's like he wanna manage me as a rapper AND a producer I'm like oh shit I was messin with, uh, D-Dot also ghost production but that's how I got in the game. If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't be here I was stayin in Chicago, I had my own apartment, I be doin like, just beats for local acts just to try to keep the lights on, and then to go out and buy, get a Pelle Pelle off lay-away get some Jordans or something TechnoMarine I made this one beat where I sped up this Harold Melvin sample Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin, called The Dynasty. I was listening to Dre Chronic 2001 at that time. And really I just, like bit the drums off "Xxplosive" and put it like with it sped up, sampled, and now it's kind of like my whole style, when it started, when he rapped on "This Can't be Life." And that was like, really the first beat of that kind that was on The Dynasty album. the resurgence of the soul sound and I got to meet Jay-Z and he said, "Oh you a real soulful dude." [Jay-Z: "Oh you a real soulful dude, man"] You know how he do it, one take And he said  [Jay-Z: "Check this out, tell me what you think of this, right here"]  "Tell me what you think of this." And I heard it, and I was thinking like, man, I really wanted more like of the simple type Jay-Z. I ain't want like the, the more introspective, complicated rhy- or the... in my personal opinion. So he asked me, "What you think of it?"  [Jay-Z: "so what you think of this?"]  And I was like, "Man that shit tight," you know what I'm sayin', man what I'ma tell him? I was on the train, man, you know. So after that I went back home. And man I'm, I'm just in Chicago, I'm trying to do my thing. You know, I got groups. I got acts I'm trying to get on, and like there wasn't nothin really like poppin' off the way it should have been. One of my homies that was one of my artists, he got signed. But it was supposed to really go through my production company, but he ended up going straight with the company. So, like I'm just straight holdin' the phone, gettin' the bad news that dude was tryin' to leave my company. And I got evicted at the same time. So I went down and tracked the beats from him, I took that money, came back, packed all my shit up in a U-Haul, maybe about ten days before I had to actually get out so I ain't have to deal with the landlord cause he's a jerk. Me and my mother drove to...  [Mother: "Come on, let's just go"]  ...Newark, New Jersey. I hadn't even seen my apartment. I remember I pulled up...  [Mother: "Kanye, baby, we're here"]  ...I unpacked all my shit. I bought a bed, I put the bed together myself. the first beat I made was, uh, "Heart of the City." And Beans was still working on his album at that time so I came up there to Baseline, it was Beans' birthday "Nothing Like It" but then Jay walked in. I remember he had a Gucci bucket hat on. I remember it like, like it was yesterday. And Hiphop said, "Yo play that one beat for him." And I played "Heart of the City." And really I made "Heart of the City," I really wanted to give that beat To DMX And I played another beat, and I played another beat. And I remember that Gucci bucket, he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like 'OOOOOOOOOOH.' Two days later I'm in Baseline and I seen Dame. Dame didn't know who I was and I was like, "Yo what's up I'm Kanye."  [Dame: "Yo, you that kid, Kanye?"]  "You that kid that gave all them beats to Jay? Yo, this nigga got classics"  [Dame: "Jay got classics, G."] And all this time I'm starstruck, man still thinking 'bout, you know I'm picturing these niggas on the show, The Streets is Watching, I'm lookin, these were superstars in my eyes. And they still are, you know. Lenny S, Louis Vuitton sneakers on, he think he fly. Ty-Ty John Meneilly And I spit this rap that said, uh "I'm killin y'all niggas on that lyrical shit. Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push miracle whips." And I saw his eyes light up when I said that line. But you know the rest, the rap was like real wack and shit, so that's all the response. So, Blueprint, "H to the Izzo," my first hit single. My relationship with Kweli I think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my career as a rapper. Because, you know, of course later he allowed me to go on tour with him. Man, I appre-- I love him for that. And at this time, you know I didn't have a deal, I had songs, and I had relationships with all these A&R's they wanted beats from me, so they'd call me up, I'd play them some beats. "Gimme a beat that sound like Jay-Z." You know, they dick riders. Whatever. So I'll play them these post-Blueprint beats or whatever and then I'll play my shit. I'll be like, "yo but I rap too." I guess they was lookin' at me crazy cause you know, cause I ain't have a jersey on or whatever everybody out there listen here. I played them 'Jesus Walks' and they didn't sign me. Like, Dave Lighty fucked with me, Jessica Rivera, man...  [Jessica: "Man, you niggas is stupid if y'all don't sign Kanye, for real."] The nigga that was behind me, I mean, he wasn't even a nigga, you know? The person who actually kicked everything off was Joe 3H from Capitol Records. He wanted to sign me really bad Dame was like, "Yo you got a deal with Capitol? Okay man, just make sure it's not wack."  [Dame: "You gotta make sure it's not wack."] Young Guru So I played... actually it's a song that you'll never hear, but maybe I might use it. So, it's called 'Wow.' I go to Jacob with 25 thou, you go with 25 hundred, wow I got eleven plaques on my walls right now You got your first gold single, damn, nigga, wow." Like the chorus went. Don't bite that chorus, I might still use it. So I play that song for him he's like "oh shit"  [Dame: "Oh shit it's not even wack."]  "I ain't gonna front, it's kinda hot."  [Dame: "it's actually kinda hot."]  Like they still weren't looking at me like a rapper. And I'm sure Dame figured, 'like man. If he do a whole album, if his raps is wack at least we can throw Cam on every song and save the album, you know So uh Dame took me into the office, and he's like "yo man, B, B, you don't want a brick, you don't want a brick"  [Dame: "you don't wanna catch a brick"]  "You gotta be under an umbrella, you'll get rained on." 3H. "oh he's just a producer rapper" the day I'm talking about, I planned out everything I was gonna do. Man, I had picked out clothes, I already started booking studio sessions, I started arranging my album, thinking of marketing schemes, man I was ready to go. they had Mel call me, they said, "yo... Capitol pulled on the deal"  [Mel: "Yo, Capitol pulled out on the deal."] I went up... I called G, I said, "man, you think we could still get that deal with Roc-A-Fella?" [So won't you raise your glass, won't you...]

The question is detrimental, paralyzin' my thoughts Parasites in my stomach keep me with a gut feeling, y'all Gotta see how Im chillin' once I park this luxury car Hopping out feeling big as Mutombo "20 on pump 6" - dirty Marcellus called me Dumbo 20 years ago - can't forget Now I can lend all my ear or two how to stack these residuals Tenfold; the liberal concept of what men'll do "20 on 6" - he didn't hear me Indigenous African only spoke Zulu My American tongue was slurry Walked out the gas station A homeless man with a semi-tan complexion Asked me for ten rand, stressin' about dry land Deep water, powder blue skies that crack open A piece of crack that he wanted, I knew he was smokin' He begged and pleaded Asked me to feed him twice, I didn't believe it Told him, "Beat it" Contributin' money just for his pipe, I couldn't see it He said, "My son, temptation is one thing that I've defeated Listen to me, I want a single bill from you Nothin' less, nothin' more" I told him I ain't have it and closed my door Tell me how much a dollar cost [Hook: James Fauntleroy] It's more to feed your mind Water, sun and love, the one you love All you need, the air you breathe [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] He's starin' at me in disbelief My temper is buildin', he's starin' at me, I grab my key He's starin' at me, I started the car, then I tried to leave And somethin' told me to keep it in park until I could see The reason why he was mad at a stranger Like I was supposed to save him Like I'm the reason he's homeless and askin' me for a favor He's starin' at me, his eyes followed me with no laser He's starin' at me, I notice that his stare is contagious Cause now I'm starin' back at him, feelin' some type of disrespect If I could throw a bat at him, it'd be aimin' at his neck I never understood someone beggin' for goods Askin' for handouts, takin' it if they could And this particular person just had it down pat Starin' at me for the longest until he finally asked Have you ever opened up Exodus 14? A humble man is all that we ever need Tell me how much a dollar cost [Hook: James Fauntleroy] It's more to feed your mind Water, sun and love, the one you love All you need, the air you breathe [Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar] Guilt trippin' and feelin' resentment I never met a transient that demanded attention They got me frustrated, indecisive and power trippin' Sour emotions got me lookin' at the universe different I should distance myself, I should keep it relentless My selfishness is what got me here, who the fuck I'm kiddin'?

The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows they propel it Let my word be your earth and moon you consume every message As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression And if you riding with me nigga, let me ask this question nigga [Outro: Kendrick Lamar & 2Pac] [Kendrick Lamar] "I remember you was conflicted Misusing your influence Sometimes I did the same Abusing my power, full of resentment Resentment that turned into a deep depression Found myself screaming in the hotel room I didnt wanna self destruct The evils of Lucy was all around me So I went running for answers Until I came home But that didnt stop survivors guilt Going back and forth trying to convince myself the stripes I earned Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was But while my loved ones was fighting the continuous war back in the city, I was entering a new one A war that was based on apartheid and discrimination Made me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what I learned The word was respect Just because you wore a different gang color than mine's Doesnt mean I cant respect you as a black man Forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets If I respect you, we unify and stop the enemy from killing us But I dont know, Im no mortal man, maybe Im just another nigga Shit and thats all I wrote I was gonna call it Another Nigga but, it aint really a poem, I just felt like its something you probably could relate to. Other than that, now that I finally got a chance to holla at you, I always wanted to ask you about a certain situa--, about a metaphor actually, you spoke on the ground. What you mean bout that, what the ground represent? [2Pac] The ground is gonna open up and swallow the evil  [Kendrick Lamar] Right  [2Pac] Thats how I see it, my word is bond. I see--and the ground is the symbol for the poor people, the poor people is gonna open up this whole world and swallow up the rich people. Cause the rich people gonna be so fat, they gonna be so appetising, you know what Im saying, wealthy, appetising. The poor gonna be so poor and hungry, you know what Im saying its gonna be like there might be some cannibalism out this mutha, they might eat the rich [Kendrick Lamar] Aight so let me ask you this then, do you see yourself as somebody thats rich or somebody that made the best of their own opportunities? [2Pac] I see myself as a natural born hustler, a true hustler in every sense of the word. I took nothin, I took the opportunities, I worked at the most menial and degrading job and built myself up so I could get it to where I owned it. I went from having somebody manage me to me hiring the person that works my management company. I changed everything I realized my destiny in a matter of five years you know what Im saying I made myself a millionaire. I made millions for a lot of people now its time to make millions for myself, you know what Im saying. I made millions for the record companies, I made millions for these movie companies, now I make millions for us [Kendrick Lamar] And through your different avenues of success, how would you say you managed to keep a level of sanity?  [2Pac] By my faith in God, by my faith in the game, and by my faith in "all good things come to those that stay true." You know what Im saying, and it was happening to me for a reason, you know what Im saying, I was noticing, shit, I was punching the right buttons and it was happening. So its no problem, you know I mean its a problem but Im not finna let them know. Im finna go straight through Would you consider yourself a fighter at heart or somebody that only reacts when they back is against the wall? [2Pac] Shit, I like to think that at every opportunity Ive ever been threatened with resistance, its been met with resistance. And not only me but it goes down my family tree. You know what Im saying, its in my veins to fight back Aight well, how long you think it take before niggas be like, we fighting a war, Im fighting a war I cant win and I wanna lay it all down [2Pac] In this country a black man only have like 5 years we can exhibit maximum strength and thats right now while you a teenager, while you still strong or while you still wanna lift weights, while you still wanna shoot back. Cause once you turn 30 its like they take the heart and soul out of a man, out of a black man in this country. And you dont wanna fight no more. And if you dont believe me you can look around, you dont see no loud mouth 30-year old muthafuckas [Kendrick Lamar] Thats crazy, because me being one of your offspring of the legacy you left behind I can truly tell you that theres nothing but turmoil goin on so I wanted to ask you what you think is the future for me and my generation today? [2Pac] I think that niggas is tired of grabbin' shit out the stores and next time its a riot theres gonna be, like, uh, bloodshed for real. I dont think America know that. I think American think we was just playing and its gonna be some more playing but it aint gonna be no playing. Its gonna be murder, you know what Im saying, its gonna be like Nat Turner, 1831, up in this muthafucka. You know what Im saying, its gonna happen [Kendrick Lamar] Thats crazy man. In my opinion, only hope that we kinda have left is music and vibrations, lotta people dont understand how important it is. Sometimes I be like, get behind a mic and I dont know what type of energy Imma push out, or where it comes from. Trip me out sometimes [2Pac] Because the spirits, we aint even really rappin, we just letting our dead homies tell stories for us [Kendrick Lamar] Damn I wanted to read one last thing to you. Its actually something a good friend had wrote describing my world. It says: The caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it Its only job is to eat or consume everything around it, in order to protect itself from this mad city While consuming its environment the caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive One thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him, but praises the butterfly The butterfly represents the talent, the thoughtfulness, and the beauty within the caterpillar But having a harsh outlook on life the caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak and figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits Already surrounded by this mad city the caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon which institutionalizes him He can no longer see past his own thoughts Hes trapped When trapped inside these walls certain ideas take roots, such as going home, and bringing back new concepts to this mad city The result? Wings begin to emerge, breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant Finally free, the butterfly sheds light on situations that the caterpillar never considered, ending the internal struggle Although the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different, they are one and the same." Whats your perspective on that? Pac? Pac? Pac?! 
[Produced by Willie B] We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us Hurt people that love us, love people I'm inspired, so get inspired And so he said "Why you gotta be so kind hearted? Why you couldn't be a con artist? Why you couldn't? Why you couldn't be mischievous or just a lil devious The moment that we first started? Why you never ask for nothing, just a lil time? Why you let me use yours cus I don't got mine? Why you always lift me up, when I'm completely giving up Or when niggas holla, "What's up?" you give a dry response? Why you giving me your last knowing you ain't got it? Why you always buy me something when you going shopping? Why you tell me that you love me, Why you always thinking of me Want my company rather than going club hopping? Why you treating my momma like she your momma too? Why you making promises that you'll forever do? Whatever just to make me happy, wanting us to have a family These are exactly the reasons why I cheat on you" (Sometimes) We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us Sometimes I, sometimes I feel we share Nothing in common, it ain't fair But where do we seem to fall Where do we seem to fall Tender love and care, once upon a time Once upon a time, we was there And so she said "Why you gotta be so mean to me? Why you don't know what you mean to me? Why you always playing games? Why I feel like you ashamed Out in public curse me out and make a scenery? Why you got other bitches rolling their eyes at me? Why text messages popping up saying, "Hi, Daddy"? Why you treat me like I'm nothing? Why you always at a function? I be wanting to go out but you dont ever ask me Why you slip and say her name when we having sex? Why you always assuming that I still love my ex? Everytime we get into it, I'm the one that's feeling stupid You don't need me, you gon' leave me, that's ya favorite threat Why you never know how it feel to be lonely? Why I feel I'm the last option after ya homies? Why you always gotta know that I will never let you go Even tho you get violent and put your hands on me?" (Sometimes) [Outro: Lamont Carey] She says she loves me She says she loves me So she clings to me, even when I want to be left alone But she's beautiful Like sometimes when I have things on my mind,shes the perfect person to listen And she only gives advice She says she loves me And she only gives advice She says she loves me Like when I wake up in the morning, shes sitting on the edge of the bed with a plate of food, wanting to feed me She says she needs me She says she loves me Or like when I'm stepping out of the shower, she's standing there with the towel, wanting to, wanting to dry me off She says, she says she loves me So instead of admitting that she has made another mistake She says she loves me... and I don't know about love

[Produced by Terrace Martin] I do what I wanna do I say what I wanna say When I feel, and I Look in the mirror and know I'm there With my hands in the air I'm proud to say yeah I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real [Verse 1] I promise that I know you very well Your eyes never lie, even if they tell Sweet lullabies that come with a smell Of a dozen roses flipping down the green hill You're living in a world that come with plan B Cause plan A never relay a guarantee And plan C never could say just what it was And your plans only can pan around love You love him, you love them, you love her You love so much, you love when love hurts You love red bottom and gold that say "Queen" You love hand-bag on the waist of your jean You love French tip and trip that pay for You love bank slip that tell you we paid more You love a good hand whenever the card dealt But what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself? I do what I wanna do I say what I wanna say, when I feel, and I Look in the mirror and know I'm there With my hands in the air, I'm proud to say yeah I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real I'm real, I'm real, (cause before you know it, everything's gone) I promise that I know you very well Your eyes never lie, even if they fell Out the sky and your optics turn stale Where they mold that's green, I can see you fit the bill Of living in a world that come with plan B Cause plan A only can make another mistake And you can't see success coming from plan C When it all breaks, you'll still say you're lovely And love them and love when you love her You love so much, you love when love hurts You love fast cars and dead presidents old You love fast women, you love keepin' control Of everything that you love, you love beef You love streets, you love running, ducking police You love your hood, might even love it to death But what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself? [Verse 3] The reason why I know you very well Cause we have the same eyes, can't you tell? The days I tried to cover up and conceal My pride, it only made it harder for me to deal When living in a world that come with plan B A scapegoat cause plan A don't come free And plan C just an excuse like "because" Or the word "but," but what if I got love? I love them, I love when I love her I love so much, I love when love hurts I love first verse cause you're the girl I attract I love second verse cause you're the homie that pack Burner like a stove top, that love cooking from scratch I love what the both of you have to offer In fact, I love it so much, I don't love anything else But what love got to do with it when I don't love myself To the point I should hate everything I do love? Should I hate living my life inside the club? Should I hate her for watching me for that reason? Should I hate him for telling me that I'm seizin'? Should I hate them for telling me "ball out"? Should I hate street credibility I'm talkin' about Hating all money, power, respect in my will Or hating the fact none of that shit make me real?

Come back a man, tell your story to these black and brown kids in Compton. Let 'em know you was just like them, but you still rose from that dark place of violence, becoming a positive person. But when you do make it, give back with your words of encouragement, and that's the best way to give back. To your city... And I love you Kendrick, if I don't hear you knocking on the door you know where I usually leave the key. Alright? Talk to you later, bye."

Part 1 - Sing About Me [Produced by Sounwave and Skhye Hutch] When the lights shut off And it's my turn to settle down My main concern Promise that you will sing about me Promise that you will sing about me I said when the lights shut off And it's my turn to settle down My main concern Promise that you will sing about me Promise that you will sing about me [Verse 1] I woke up this morning and figured I'd call you In case I'm not here tomorrow, I'm hoping that I can borrow A peace of mind, I'm behind on what's really important My mind is really distorted, I find nothing but trouble in my life I'm fortunate you believe in a dream This orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine And last night was just another distraction or a reaction Of what we consider madness, I know exactly what happened You ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help Held him like a newborn baby and made him feel Like everything was alright and a fight he tried to put up But the type of bullet that stuck had went against his will As blood spilled on your hands, my plans rather vindictive Everybody's a victim in my eyes When I ride, it's a murderous rhythm and outside became pitch black A demon glued to my back whispering, "Get em" I got 'em, and I ain't give a fuck That same mentality that told my brother not to duck In actuality, it's a trip how we trip off of colors I wonder if I'll ever discover a passion like you and recover The life that I knew as a young'n in pajamas and dun-ta-duns When thunder comes it rains cats and dogs Dumb niggas like me never prosper Prognosis of a problem child, I'm proud and well devoted This piru shit been in me forever So forever I'mma push it, wherever, whenever And I love you cause you love my brother like you did Just promise me you'll tell this story when you make it big And if I die before your album drop, I hope (gunshots) [Verse 2] You wrote a song about my sister on your tape And called it Section.80, the message resembled "Brenda's Got a Baby" What's crazy was, I was hearin about it But doubted your ignorance how could you ever just put her on blast and shit Judging her past and shit, well it's completely my future Her nigga behind me right now asking for ass and shit And I'mma need that 40 dollars even if I gotta Fuck, suck and swallow in the parking lot Gonzales Park, I'm followed by a married man, a father of three My titties bounce on the cadence of his tinkling keys Matter of fact, he my favorite cause he tip me with E's He got a cousin named David and I seen him last week This is the life of another girl damaged by the system These foster homes, I run away and never do miss 'em See, my hormones just run away and if I can get 'em back To where they used to be then I'll probably be in the denim Of a family gene that show women how to be women Or better yet, a leader, you need her to learn somethin' Then you probably need to beat her, that's how I was taught Three niggas in one room, first time I was tossed And I'm exhausted, but fuck that "Sorry for your loss" shit My sister died in vain, but what point are you trying to gain If you can't fit the pumps I walk in? I'll wait Your rebuttal a little too late And if you have a album date, just make sure I'm not in the song Cause I don't need the attention bring enough of that on my own And matter fact, did I mention that I physically feel great? A doctor's approval is a waste of time, I know I'm straight I'll probably live longer than you and never fade away I'll never fade away, I'll never fade away, I know my fate And I'm on the grind for this cake, I'mma get it or die trying I'm eyeing every male gender with intentions of buying You lying to these motherfuckers, talking about you can help 'em With my story, you can help me if you sell this pussy for me, nigga Don't ignore me, nigga, fuck your glory, nigga... [Verse 3] Sometimes I look in a mirror and ask myself: Am I really scared of passing away? If it's today, I hope I hear a Cry out from heaven so loud it can water down a demon With the holy ghost 'til it drown in the blood of Jesus I wrote some raps that make sure that my lifeline Reeking the scent of a reaper, ensuring that my allegiance With the other side may come soon, and if I'm doomed May the womb help my mother be blessed for many moons I suffer a lot, and every day the glass mirror Get tougher to watch; I tie my stomach in knots And I'm not sure why I'm infatuated with death My imagination is surely an aggravation of threats That can come about, cause the tongue is mighty powerful And I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch Maybe cause I'm a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death Really stuck in the schema of wonderin' when I'mma rest And you're right, your brother was a brother to me And your sister's situation was the one that pulled me In a direction to speak of something that's realer than the TV screen By any means, wasn't trying to offend or come between Her personal life, I was like "It need to be told" Cursing the life of twenty generations after her soul Exactly what'd happen if I ain't continued rappin' Or steady being distracted by money drugs and four- Fives, I count lives all on these songs Look at the weak and cry, pray one day, you'll be strong Fighting for your rights even when you're wrong And hope that at least one of you sing about me when I'm gone Am I worth it? Did I put enough work in? Promise that you will sing about me Promise that you will sing about me I said when the lights shut off And it's my turn to settle down My main concern Promise that you will sing about me Promise that you will sing about me (Promise that you'll sing about me forever Promise that you'll sing about me for-ooooh) (On the phone:) "Nigga, the homie's brother-- nigga, right here, he gone, my nigga, he gone!" "Nigga-- they just killed the homie's brother, my nigga. We right here on the block, my nigga." "Al- alright, nigga-- nigga just come-- alright, alright, just call me back, man, just call me back." (Hangs up) "Arghh... *fuck!* ...So what we gon' do, my niggas? What we gon' do?" "Bro, we can go back right now, my nigga. Like... nigga, I don't give a FUCK, my nigga. We can go back right now.*" "Fuck! I'm tired of this shit! I'm tired of fuckin' runnin', I'm tired of this shit! My brother, homie!"

Channel 9, cameras is looking It's hard to channel your energy when you know you're crooked Banana clip, split his banana pudding I'm like Tre, that's Cuba Gooding I know I'm good at Dying of thirst, dying of thirst, dying of thirst How many sins? I'm running out How many sins? I lost count Dreams of balling like Spalding But only shotty bounce The reaper calling, I'm cottonmouth Money is power (money is power) Yours is ours (yours is ours) Lay with a snitch, die with a coward Hope we get rich, hope we can tower Over the city with vanity with the music louder The same song, a black flower I'll show you how to dye your thirst, dye your thirst, dye your thirst What are we doing? Who are we fooling? Hell is hot, fire is proven To burn for eternity, return of the student That never learned how to live righteous but how to shoot it Tired of running, choirs is hummin' Tell us to visit, we lying 'bout comin' Now back to business, loading the guns in Back of the Buick, your hood is feuding, and the beef is bubblin' It's no discussion Hereditary, all of my cousins Dying of thirst, dying of thirst, dying of thirst Too many sins, I'm running out Somebody send me a well for the drought See, all I know, is taking notes On taking this life for granted, granted, if he provoke My best days, are stress days (Lord, forgive me for all my sins for I not know...) My best days, are stress days Say "Fuck the world," my sex slave Money, pussy and greed; what's my next crave Whatever it is, know it's my next grave Tired of running, tired of running Tired of tumbling, tired of running Tired of tumbling Back once my momma say "See a pastor, give me a promise What if today was the rapture, and you completely tarnished The truth will set you free, so to me be completely honest You dying of thirst, you dying of thirst So hop in that water, and pray that it works" [Skit/Outro] Fuck! Im tired of this shit! Im tired of fuckin' runnin', Im tired of this shit! Thats my brother, homie! "Young man, come talk to me! Is that what I think that is? I know that's not what I think that is Why are you so angry? See you young men are dying of thirst Do you know what that means? That means you need water, holy water You need to be baptized, with the spirit of The Lord Do you want to receive God as your personal savior? Okay, repeat after me "Lord God, I come to you a sinner" (Lord God, I come to you a sinner) "And I humbly repent for my sins" (And I humbly repent for my sins) "I believe that Jesus is Lord" (I believe Jesus is Lord) "I believe you raised him from the dead" (I believe you raised him from the dead) "I would ask that Jesus come into my life" (I would ask that Jesus come in my life) "And to be my Lord and Savior" (And to be my Lord and Savior) "I receive Jesus to take control of my life" (I receive Jesus to take control of my life) "And that I may live with him from this day forward" (And that I may live with him from this day forward) "Thank you Lord Jesus for saving me with your precious blood" (Thank you Lord Jesus for saving me with your precious blood) "In Jesus name, amen" (In Jesus name, amen) "Alright now, remember this day: the start of a new life Your REAL life."

Alex, you gotta fend for yourself. He started retreatin and readin every treatise on the shelf There would have been nothin left to do For someone less astute He woulda been dead or destitute Without a cent of restitution Started workin, clerkin for his late mothers landlord Tradin sugar cane and rum and all the things he cant afford Scammin for every book he can get his hands on Plannin for the future see him now as he stands on The bow of a ship headed for a new land In New York you can be a new man In New York you can Be a new man In New York you can Be a new man In New York you can be a new man Just you wait!

Yeah, I say, bitch bad Woman good, lady better Hey, hey, hey, hey [Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco] Now imagine there's a shorty, maybe five, maybe four Riding 'round with his mama listening to the radio And a song comes on and a not far off from being born Doesn't know the difference between right and wrong Now, I ain't trying to make it too complex But let's just say shorty has an undeveloped context About the perception of women these days His mama sings along, and this what she says "Niggas, I'm a bad bitch, and I'm bad, bitch! Somethin' that's far above average." And maybe other rhyming words like cabbage and savage And baby carriage and other things that match it Couple of things are happenin' here First he's relatin' the word bitch with his mama comma And because she's relatin' to herself As most important source of help And mental health, he may skew respect for dishonor [Hook: Lupe Fiasco] Bitch bad, woman good Lady better, they misunderstood (I'm killin' these bitches) Uh, tell 'em, bitch bad Woman good, lady better They misunderstood They misunderstood [Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco] Yeah, now imagine a group of little girls 9 through 12 On the Internet watching videos Listening to songs by themselves It doesn't really matter if they have parental clearance They understand the Internet better than their parents Now, being the Internet, the content's probably uncensored They're young, so they're malleable and probably unmentored A complicated combination, maybe with no relevance Until that intelligence meets their favorite singer's preference "Bad bitches, bad bitches, bad bitches That's all I want and all I like in life is bad bitches, bad bitches." Now, let's say that they less concerned with him And more with the video girl acquiescent to his whims Ah, the plot thickens: high heels, long hair, fat booty, slim Reality check, I'm not trippin' They don't see a paid actress, just what makes a bad bitch [Hook: Lupe Fiasco] Bitch bad, woman good Lady better, they misunderstood (I'm killin' these bitches) I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say Bitch bad, woman good Lady better, they misunderstood (I'm killin' these bitches) [Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco] Disclaimer: this rhymer, Lupe, is not using "bitch" as a lesson But as a psychological weapon To set in your mind and really mess with your conceptions Discretions, reflections, it's clever misdirection Cause while I was rappin' they was growin' up fast Nobody stepped in to ever slow 'em up, gasp Sho' enough, in this little world The little boy meets one of those little girls And he thinks she a bad bitch and she thinks she a bad bitch He thinks disrespectfully, she thinks of that sexually She got the wrong idea, he don't wanna fuck her He think she's bad at being a bitch like his mother Momma never dressed like that Come out the house, hot mess like that Ass, titties, dressed like that, all out to impress like that Just like that, you see the fruit of the confusion He caught in a reality, she caught in an illusion Bad mean good to her, she really nice and smart But bad mean bad to him, bitch don't play a part But bitch still bad to her if you say it the wrong way But she think she a bitch; what a double entendre! [Hook: Lupe Fiasco] Tell 'em, bitch bad, woman good Lady better, they misunderstood I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say Bitch bad, woman good Lady better, they misunderstood They misunderstood Bitch bad, woman good Lady better, they misunderstood You're misunderstood (I'm killin' these bitches) Bitch bad, woman good Lady better, greatest motherhood (I'm killin' these bitches) 
[Produced by Wiz Buchanan, Keyz and Quality Kid for GITM] [Verse] We're all chemicals, vitamins and minerals Vicodin with inner tubes, wrapped around the arm To see the vein like a chicken on the barn Top Cat chat, let's begin another yarn That's flying saucer cheese, or is it chicken parm'? But roosters don't fly like boosters don't buy So what powers cowards to get them to the top Just to fall asleep listening to Bach? The ribbon in the sky is the riddim that I drop Dribbling the eye across the prism of a clock That lacks meaning, but racks up stacks of fat reading They catch Chief and wrapped up plants from trap dealings Now what's a coffin with a scratched ceiling? And what's the talking without the match feeling That's buried living? And cherry picking Every lemon from your berry system Then proceed with the pack feeding When I was young I had visions of another world Sneaking looks at the porn stash of my brother Hurl Incense smoke made vortices and other curls Casting calls from porn films and ad space for rubber girls I like my pancakes cut in swirls Moroccan moles and undercover squirrels I like cartoons, southern cities with large moons Faith healers, ex-female drug dealers and art booms Apologize for my weird mix What taste like hot dogs and tear drips And looks like pantomime and clear bricks And smells like shotguns and deer piss They on their hunt, kind of salty that I'm going hard First part of a party, that I throw in parts One minute you're playing pool, next minute you're throwing darts But that's how you do with a party that you throw in bars I run the Gambit like I'm throwing cards From popular mechanics to overdosing hearts Paint cold pictures like Nova Scotia landscapes Nerd gang, make Mandelbrot sets when we handshake A word game back up plan that can dam lakes Backup the wordplay playing at the man's states Means I can still be the man if the dam breaks And when demand brakes I'm reflectious, what they can't face My peers will still treat the mirror like it's a fan base The unfettered veteran, the eagle feathered man of medicine That hovers above cities like weather men And maybe weather woman Whatever better to tell ya weather comin' I prefer girls to reign all over the world And not rain like, rain man or rain like rain dance Or rain like a slight chance of rain when it's raining Or rein like deer slaves to Santa Claus sleigh man But reign like Queens that reign over made man And not Queen like Queen killer, rhapsody bohemian Queen But Queen, like white glove wave hand, and not wave hand, like it's a heat wave So you make a fan by waving your hand, I'm talking wave, like you saying, "Hey man!" And not hay for horses, and hoarse like you almost voiceless You gotta treat your vocal chords, like it's a fortress And treat every single one of your words, like reinforcements And especially when you're recording Cause that's the portion that's important When I was reporting, that I was poor, but now I'm more than (poor) It's still hooker heels, on my sugar hills, and sweet spots Crying shames, make margarita rims, from cheap tops Deep plots, in floor to ceiling windows, for my peep pots A little scene, with the sickle swings, to make the wheat drop And a hundred words, for them hummingbirds, that like to eavesdrop And fan out, like peacocks, with a parakeet that beat box So the sun rise, when the beat drops, and the sun dies, when the beat stops... Then it unties, then it relocks, then it relapsed, then it detox Then heat back, like a heat pack, on his knee caps of the weak spot Cause he want what we got, like yeah Then forge poetry, like a young ornery Morrissey Then spit it to the golden locks thots, who like their porridge all watery Not scorching, nor sorbet-y From the steel orbitings, sorcerer, sorcery Coming down gorgeously, just like a Stacey Dash waterfall A more torturing, a water-boarding, Barbie doll A river of women, like a Brazilian Carnival Swimming in feminine bikinis, made out of Barbasol Somebody give them the volleyballs If you love her, don't ever send her to Mally Mall's Homie, if she lonely she might end up in Macauly's claws Coming out the closet over goblets, down at Madri Gras The fame, champagne, walk of shame lobby call My rap position, was black condition, and activism Ammunition for abolition, missions attacking systems But they're not apt to listen, unless it's dropping on Activision Are we apps, or are we bodies filled with apparitions? Operating applications, stuck inside an Apple prison Chicken hack, and download updates that lack religion Or are we more... ...Than soil tainting, disloyal changelings Preoccupied with boy and Goyle chasing, and foiling other's royal saintings? I sit back and watch the world, through eye holes, in my oil paintings Uhhh! Ain't nothin' to it, but to do it Unless you Virgin Mary, nothin' do it but the truest Believe all that, unless you Jewish Life is not a dictionary, it's a thesaurus And I feel like a missionary, to a clitoris The water bearer, heir of traditions, that I swear to never change My chair position, or conditions of my porridge Submission for sedition, against the religion of a chorus Keep them golden weave thieves, out the mothafuckin' forest As I perform a nerve storm, I prefer my pictures in word form Bury the hatchet, like how a bird born As I paint cold pictures, like Kool-Aid facing condensation Having conversations with flavorful combinations Slave to my concentration, so that's OJ da Juiceman, meets OJ with two hands And two gloves, that's too snug, to judge who was, who drew blood And, Lupe look at all these toucans, in a cemetery full of tomahawks Giving middle fingers, to the pigeons doing somersaults Road runners don't fall off cliffs, they run across Anomalies by the colony, flukes by the reservoir Wildin' pursuers end up as poofs, on the desert floor Levitating youths, who know the truth of where the fountain hides Buccaro roof painting tunnels, onto the mountain sides A thousand parts, a pound of heart, an ounce of eyes Announcing now, the doubt in mouth, pronounces a count of lies Chocula Counts, by the count of five Refrigerator roof, full of animals and monsters Incinerator chutes and the manual for Contra Assorted memories from my childhood Absorbing energy from the wild woods Electronic combat Konami sign contract Chinese chalk killing cucarachas on contact Chicago, spray gun aficionado Efficient spitting bridging divisions isn't Chicano Whos the Boss? If it isn't Alyssa Milano Dudikoff ninja mission into the Congo Polarize envy of the older guys Black obi, shinobi hittin' Kenno in the face with all my throwin' knives Sub-zero guiding, hiding, riding in the pack as well Sound village, Leaf village, wolf spirit, magic spells Dodging rain and catching hail Faces need samurais to catch the L Special research vessels made for catching whales Filet-o-fish ships sea-shepherded peppered with extra sails Rewrite history, liberty needs a better bell Maybe harder irons and carbon fibers that never fail Smarter science mixed with a odd alliance of fairy tale Or maybe just a metal pail you hit with steel tools To announce that you've had enough and dropping out of SEAL school Just like trout jumping out their house to let their gills cool Cuba-scuba couldn't take the temperature of my skill pool Yeah, I said it feels cool to kill fools Slipping through the cracks like when you try to grill gruel Techno Viking water bottle and not following pill rules Will have you off the throttle when you should be modelin' chill mood Roller skater maker or are you just cobblin' wheel shoes Overweight taster of kings food that kills crews Oblivious feather-weight baker who autographed cakes whenever his quill moves over your milieu Simple as a Buddhist monk in a temple standing in some heel groove with the abbot, practising stillness Real still til' he realize his realness Defeat Samsara, achieves nirvana and brilliance Yeah!

[Piano Intro] [Verse 1: Macklemore] When I was in the 3rd grade I thought that I was gay Cause I could draw, my uncle was And I kept my room straight I told my mom, tears rushing down my face She's like, "Ben, you've loved girls since before Pre-K!" Tripping, yeah, I guess she had a point, didn't she? A bunch of stereotypes all in my head I remember doing the math, like "Yeah, I'm good at little league" A pre-conceived idea of what it all meant For those that like the same sex had the characteristics The right-wing conservatives think it's a decision And you can be cured with some treatment and religion Man-made, rewiring of a pre-disposition, playing God Ahh, nah, here we go America the brave still fears what we don't know And "God loves all his children" is somehow forgotten But we paraphrase a book written thirty-five hundred years ago I don't know [Hook: Mary Lambert] And I can't change Even if I tried Even if I wanted to And I can't change Even if I tried Even if I wanted to My love, my love, my love She keeps me warm [x4] [Verse 2: Macklemore] If I was gay I would think hip-hop hates me Have you read the YouTube comments lately? "Man, that's gay" gets dropped on the daily We've become so numb to what we're saying Our culture founded from oppression Yet we don't have acceptance for 'em Call each other faggots Behind the keys of a message board A word rooted in hate Yet our genre still ignores it "Gay" is synonymous with the lesser It's the same hate that's caused wars from religion Gender to skin color, the complexion of your pigment The same fight that led people to walk-outs and sit-ins It's human rights for everybody, there is no difference Live on! And be yourself! When I was in church they taught me something else If you preach hate at the service, those words aren't anointed That Holy Water that you soak in has been poisoned When everyone else is more comfortable remaining voiceless Rather than fighting for humans that have had their rights stolen I might not be the same but that's not important No freedom til we're equal Damn right I support it [Trombone Interlude] We press play, don't press pause Progress, march on! With a veil over our eyes, we turn our back on the cause 'Til the day that my uncles can be united by law Kids are walking around the hallway Plagued by pain in their heart A world so hateful Some would rather die Than be who they are And a certificate on paper Isn't gonna solve it all But it's a damn good place to start No law's gonna change us We have to change us Whatever god you believe in We come from the same one Strip away the fear, underneath, it's all the same love About time that we raised up!

I hope that God decides to talk through him That the people decide to walk with him Regardless of Pitchfork, cosigns I've jumped Make sure the soundman doesn't cockblock the drums Let the snare knock the air right out of your lungs And those words be the oxygen Just breathe Amen, regardless I'mma say it Felt like I got signed the day that I got an agent Got an iTunes check, shit man I'm paying rent About damn time that I got out of my basement About damn time I got around the country and I hit these stages I was made to slay them Ten thousand hours I'm so damn close I can taste it On some Malcolm Gladwell David-Bowie-meets-Kanye shit This is dedication A life lived for art is never a life wasted Ten thousand Ten thousand hours felt like ten thousand hands Ten thousand hands, they carry me Now, now, now This is my world, this is my arena The TV told me something different I didn't believe it I stand here in front of you today all because of an idea I could be who I wanted if I could see my potential And I know that one day I'mma be him Put the gloves on, sparring with my ego Everyone's greatest obstacle, I beat him celebrate that achievement Got some attachments, some baggage I'm actually working on leaving See, I observed Escher I love Basquiat I watched Keith Haring You see I studied art The greats weren't great because at birth they could paint The greats were great cause they paint a lot I will not be a statistic, just let me be No Child Left Behind, that's the American scheme I make my living off of words And do what I love for work And got around 980 on my SATs Take that system What did you expect Generation of kids choosing love over a desk Put those hours in and look at what you get Nothing that you can hold, but everything that it is Ten thousand Same shit, different day, same struggle Slow motion as time slips through my knuckles Nothing beautiful about it No light at the tunnel For the people that put the passion before them being comfortable Raw, unmedicated heart, no substitute Banging on table tops, no subs to toot I'm feeling better than ever man What is up with you Scraping my knuckles, I'm battling with some drug abuse I lost another friend, got another call from a sister And I speak for the people that share that struggle too Like they got something bruised My only rehabilitation was the sweat Tears and blood when up in the booth It's the part of the show where it all fades away When the lights go to black and the band leaves the stage And you wanted a encore but there's no encore today Cause the moment is now, can't get it back from the grave Part of the show It all fades away Lights go to black Band leaves the stage You wanted an encore but there's no encore today Cause the moment is now Can't get it back from the grave Welcome to the Heist Welcome to the Heist

[Verse 1] Pulled into the parking lot, parked it Zipped up my parka, joined the procession of marchers In my head like, "Is this awkward? Should I even be here marching?" Thinking if they can't, how can I breathe? Thinking that they chant, what do I sing? I want to take a stance cause we are not free And then I thought about it, we are not "we" Am I in the outside looking in, or am I in the inside looking out? Is it my place to give my two cents? Or should I stand on the side and shut my mouth? "No justice, no peace," okay, I'm saying that They're chanting out, "Black Lives Matter," but I don't say it back Is it okay for me to say? I don't know, so I watch and stand In front of a line of police that look the same as me Only separated by a badge, a baton, a can of Mace, a mask A shield, a gun with gloves and hands that gives an alibi In case somebody dies behind a bullet that flies out of the 9 Takes another child's life on sight Blood in the streets, no justice, no peace No racist beliefs, no rest 'til we're free There's blood in the streets, no justice, no peace No racist beliefs, no rest 'til we're free Blood in the streets, no justice, no peace No racist beliefs, no rest 'til we're free There's blood in the streets, no justice, no peace No racist beliefs, no rest 'til we're free Blood in the streets, no justice, no peace No racist beliefs, no rest 'til we're free There's blood in the streets, no justice, no peace No racist beliefs, no rest 'til we're free [Interlude 1] [Macklemore, speaking over voices] "Oh, what are you doing Ben? What are you doing here?" [Various indistinct male voices] "Probably shouldn't be here, you have white supremacy, don't fuckin' come here. You don't give a shit about us. 'Black Lives Matter,' say it. Wow. 'Black Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter.' You should not have done that. Why the fuck would you do that? You always react. Just let it go, man. White racist. It's the Grammys!" [Macklemore] "Ben, think about it." [Verse 2] You've exploited and stolen the music, the moment The magic, the passion, the fashion, you toy with The culture was never yours to make better You're Miley, you're Elvis, you're Iggy Azalea Fake and so plastic, you've heisted the magic You've taken the drums and the accent you rapped in Your brand of hip-hop, it's so fascist and backwards That Grandmaster Flash'd go slap it, you bastard All the money that you made All the watered down pop-bullshit version of the culture, pal Go buy a big-ass lawn, go with your big-ass house Get a big-ass fence, keep people out It's all stolen, anyway, can't you see that now? There's no way for you to even that out You can join the march, protest, scream and shout Get on Twitter, hashtag and seem like you're down But they see through it all, people believe you now? You said publicly, "Rest in peace, Mike Brown" You speak about equality, but do you really mean it? Are you marching for freedom, or when it's convenient? Want people to like you, want to be accepted That's probably why you are out here protesting Don't think for a second you don't have incentive Is this about you, well, then what's your intention? What's the intention? What's the intention? "Hands up? Don't shoot!" "Hands up? Don't shoot!" "Hands up? Don't shoot!" "Hands up? Don't shoot!" "Hands up? Don't shoot!" "Hands up? Don't shoot!" "Hands up? Don't shoot!" "Hands up? Don't shoot!" "Hands up? Don't shoot!" "Hands up? Don't shoot!" "Hands up? Don't shoot!" "Hands up? Don't shoot!" "Hands up? Don't shoot!" "Hands up? Don't shoot!" [Verse 3] "Pssst, I totally get it, you're by yourself And the last thing you want to do is take a picture But seriously, my little girl loves you She's always singing, 'I'm gonna pop some tags' I'm not kidding, my oldest, you even got him to go thrifting And 'One Love,' oh my God, that song, brilliant Their aunt is gay, when that song came out My son told his whole class he was actually proud That's so cool, look what you're accomplishing Even the old mom like me likes it, cause it's positive You're the only hip-hop that I let my kids listen to Cause you get it, all that negative stuff it isn't cool" Yeah? "Yeah, like, all the guns and the drugs The bitches and the hoes and the gangs and the thugs Even the protest outside, so sad, and so dumb If a cop pulls you over, it's your fault if you run" Huh? [Interlude 3: Various male and female voices] "So, they feel that the police are discriminating against the... the black people? I have an advantage? Why? Cause I'm white? (laughs) What? (laughs) No. See, more people nowadays are just pussies. Like, this is the generation to be offended by everything. 'Black Lives Matter' thing is a reason to take arms up over perceived slights. I'm not prejudiced, I just... 99% of the time, across this country, the police are doing their job properly." Damn, a lot of opinions, a lot of confusion, a lot of resentment Some of us scared, some of us defensive And most of us aren't even paying attention It seems like we're more concerned with being called racist Than we actually are with racism I've heard that silences are action and God knows that I've been passive What if I actually read a article, actually had a dialogue Actually looked at myself, actually got involved? If I'm aware of my privilege and do nothing at all, I don't know Hip-hop has always been political, yes It's the reason why this music connects So what the fuck has happened to my voice if I stay silent when black people are dying Then I'm trying to be politically correct? I can book a whole tour, sell out the tickets Rap entrepreneur, built his own business If I'm only in this for my own self-interest, not the culture that gave me a voice to begin with Then this isn't authentic, it is just a gimmick The DIY underdog, so independent But the one thing the American dream fails to mention Is I was many steps ahead to begin with My skin matches the hero, likeness, the image America feels safe with my music in their systems And it's suited me perfect, the role, I've fulfilled it And if I'm the hero, you know who gets cast as the villain White supremacy isn't just a white dude in Idaho White supremacy protects the privilege I hold White supremacy is the soil, the foundation, the cement and the flag that flies outside of my home White supremacy is our country's lineage, designed for us to be indifferent My success is the product of the same system that let off Darren Wilson guilty We want to dress like, walk like, talk like, dance like, yet we just stand by We take all we want from black culture, but will we show up for black lives? We want to dress like, walk like, talk like, dance like, yet we just stand by We take all we want from black culture, but will we show up for black lives? [Interlude 4: Various male and female voices] "Black Lives Matter, to use an analogy, is like if... if there was a subdivision and a house was on fire. The fire department wouldn't show up and start putting water on all the houses because all houses matter. They would show up and they would turn their water on the house that was burning because that's the house that needs the help the most. My generation's taken on the torch of a very age-old fight for black liberation, but also liberation for everyone. Injustice anywhere is still injustice everywhere. The best thing white people can do is talk to each other, having those very difficult, very painful conversations with your parents, with your family members. I think one of the critical questions for white people in this society is, 'What are you willing to risk? What are you willing to sacrifice to create a more just society?'" [Outro: Jamila Woods] Your silence is a luxury, hip-hop is not a luxury Your silence is a luxury, hip-hop is not a luxury Your silence is a luxury, hip-hop is not a luxury Your silence is a luxury, hip-hop is not a luxury What I got for me, it is for me What we made, we made to set us free What I got for me, it is for me What we made, we made to set us free What I got for me, it is for me What we made, we made to set us free [Click here to learn more about the making of "White Privilege II"]

Dont crease 'em! Just leave 'em in that box!" Strangled by these laces, laces I can barely talk Thats my air bubble and Im lost, if it pops We are what we wear We wear what we are But see I look inside the mirror and think Phil Knight tricked us all Will I stand for change Or stay in my box These Nikes help me define me But Im trying to take mine Off I want to fly Can you take me far away Give me a star to reach for Tell me what it takes And Ill go so high Ill go so high My feet wont touch the ground Just stitch my wings And pull the strings I bought these dreams That all fall down They started out With what I wear to school That first day Like these are what make you cool And this pair, this would be my parachute So much more than just a pair of shoes Nah, this is what I am What I wore, this is the source of my youth This dream that they sold to you For a hundred dollars and some change Consumption is in the veins And now I see its just another pair of shoes 
[Intro] "Chad Butler, known as Pimp C, died in a Los Angeles hotel room..." "The L.A. County Coroners office ruled the rapper's death accidental..." "And attributed it to a combination of..." "Apnea?" "Yes." "...and syrup, and we know that syrup on the streets usually has codeine?" "Absolutely, we have a problem now with the cough syrup epidemic..." He rolled up, asked him what he was sipping on He said lean, you want to hit it, dawg? That's the same stuff Weezy's sipping huh And tons of other rappers that be spitting hard Yup, he had five up on When he passed him that Styrofoam The Easter pink, heard it in a rhyme before Finally got to see what all the hype was on And then he took a sip, sitting in the Lincoln Thinking he was pimping as he listened to the system Little did he know that it was just as addictive as base Not the kind of hit from the kick drum Hot box, let the bass bump Take it to the face, gulp Months later the use went up Every blunt was accompanied by the pink stuff But goddam, he loved that feeling Purple rain coated in the throat just so healing Medicine alleviate the sickness Liquid affix and it comes with a cost Wake up, cold sweat, scratching, itching Trying to escape the skin that barely fit him Gone, get another bottle just to get a couple swallows Headed towards the bottom couldn't get off it Didn't even think he had a problem Though he couldn't sleep without getting nauseous Room spinning Thinking he might of sipped just a little bit too much of that cough syrup His eyelids closed shut Sat back in the chair clutching that cup Girlfriend came and a couple hours later Said his name, shook him but he never got up He never got up, he never got up We live on the cusp of death thinking that it won't be us It won't be us, it won't be us, it won't be us Nah, it won't be us Now he just wanted to act like them He just wanted to rap like him Us as rappers underestimate the power and the effects that we have on these kids Blunt passed, ash in a tin Pack being pushed, harassed by the Feds The fact of it is most people that rap like this Talking about some shit they haven't lived Surprise, you know the drill Trapped in a box, declining record sales Follow the formula: violence, drugs, and sex sells So we try to sound like someone else This is not Californication There's no way to glorify this pavement Syrup, Percocet, and an eighth a day Will leave you broke, depressed, and emotionally vacant Despite how Lil Wayne lives It's not conducive to being creative And I know cause he's my favorite And I know cause I was off that same mix Rationalize the shit that I'd try after I listen to Dedication But he's an alien I'd sip that shit Pass out or play PlayStation Months later I'm in the same place No music made, feeling like a failure And trust me it's not dope to be twenty-five And move back to your parent's basement I've seen my people's dreams die I've seen what they can be denied And "Weed's not a drug," that's denial Groundhog Day, life repeat each time I've seen Oxycontin take three lives I grew up with them We used to chief dimes I've seen cocaine bring out the demons inside Cheating and lying Friendship cease, no peace in the mind Stealing and taking anything to fix the pieces inside Broken, hopeless, headed nowhere Only motivation for what the dealer's supplying That rush, that drug, that dope Those pills, that crumb, that roach Thinking I would never do that, not that drug And growing up nobody ever does Until you're stuck Looking in the mirror like I can't believe what I've become Swore I was going to be someone And growing up everyone always does We sell our dreams and our potential To escape through that buzz Just keep me up, keep me up Hollywood, here we come [Outro] You can tend to, um, go a little too far with some of these things , they have very strong addictive qualities, pills and syrups and whatnot, so um (Is it changing the music?) Um, I can only speak for myself personally, you know what I'm saying? Um, we had been taking down, toning down the content of certain things in the music lately. My new album, of course, probably won't have any references to cough syrup in it, but, uh, it's a little bit more than the music. I think it's gonna start affecting the personal lives of a lot of artists and people...

[Verse 1: AZ] Visualizing the realism of life in actuality Fuck who's the baddest, a person's status depends on salary And my mentality is money-orientated I'm destined to live the dream For all my peeps who never made it Cause, yeah, we were beginners in the hood as 5 Percenters But something must've got in us Cause all of us turned to sinners Now some resting in peace and some are sittin' in San Quentin Others, such as myself, are trying to carry on tradition Keeping this Schweppervescent street ghetto essence inside us, cause it provides us with the proper insight to guide us Even though we know, somehow we all gotta go But as long as we leaving thievin' We'll be leavin' with some kind of dough So, until that day we expire and turn to vapors Me and my capers will be somewhere stackin' plenty papers Keeping it real, packing steel, getting high Cause life's a bitch and then you die [Hook: AZ] Life's a bitch and then you die That's why we get high Cause you never know when you're gonna go Life's a bitch and then you die That's why we puff lye Cause you never know when you're gonna go [Verse 2: Nas] I woke up early on my born day; I'm 20, it's a blessing The essence of adolescence leaves my body, now I'm fresh And, my physical frame is celebrated cause I made it One quarter through life, some Godly-like thing created Got rhymes 365 days annual, plus some Load up the mic and bust one, cuss while I pus from My skull, cause it's pain in my brain vein, money maintain Don't go against the grain, simple and plain When I was young at this I used to do my thing hard Robbin' foreigners, take they wallets, they jewels And rip they green cards Dipped to the projects, flashing my quick cash And got my first piece of ass, smokin' blunts with hash Now it's all about cash in abundance Niggas I used to run with is rich or doing years in the hundreds I switched my motto; instead of saying "Fuck tomorrow!" That buck that bought a bottle could've struck the lotto Once I stood on the block, loose cracks produce stacks I cooked up and cut small pieces to get my loot back Time is Illmatic, keep static like wool fabric Pack a 4-matic to crack your whole cabbage [Hook: AZ] Life's a bitch and then you die That's why we get high Cause you never know when you're gonna go Life's a bitch and then you die That's why we puff lye Cause you never know when you're gonna go Life's a bitch and then you die [Trumpet Solo: Olu Dara] 
[Produced by DJ Premier] [Intro] Yeah, yeah Ayo, black, it's time, word (Word, it's time, man) It's time, man (Aight, man, begin) Straight out the fucking dungeons of rap Where fake niggas don't make it back I don't know how to start this shit, yo... now [Verse 1] Rappers, I monkey flip 'em with the funky rhythm I be kickin' Musician, inflictin' composition of pain I'm like Scarface sniffin' cocaine Holding an M16, see with the pen I'm extreme, now Bullet holes left in my peepholes I'm suited up in street clothes, hand me a 9 and I'll defeat foes Y'all know my steelo with or without the airplay I keep some E&J, sitting bent up in the stairway Or either on the corner betting Grants with the cee-lo champs Laughing at baseheads tryna sell some broken amps G-packs get off quick, forever niggas talk shit Reminiscing about the last time the task force flipped Niggas be running through the block shootin' Time to start the revolution, catch a body, head for Houston Once they caught us off-guard The MAC-10 was in the grass and I ran like a cheetah with thoughts of an assassin Picked the MAC up, told brothers, "Back up!" the MAC spit Lead was hittin' niggas, one ran I made him backflip Heard a few chicks scream, my arm shook, couldn't look Gave another squeeze, heard it click, "Yo, my shit is stuck" Try to cock it, it wouldn't shoot, now I'm in danger Finally pulled it back And saw three bullets caught up in the chamber So now I'm jetting to the building lobby, and it was full of children probably, couldn't see as high as I be (So what you sayin'?) It's like the game ain't the same Got younger niggas pulling the triggers Bringing fame to their name And claim some corners, crews without guns are goners In broad daylight, stickup kids, they run up on us 45's and gauges, MAC's, in fact Same niggas will catch you back-to-back Snatching your cracks in black There was a snitch on the block getting niggas knocked So hold your stash 'til the coke price drop I know this crackhead who said she got to smoke nice rock And if it's good, she'll bring you customers in measuring pots But yo, you gotta slide on a vacation, inside information Keeps large niggas erasin' and their wives basin' It drops deep as it does in my breath I never sleep, cause sleep is the cousin of death Beyond the walls of intelligence, life is defined I think of crime when I'm in a New York state of mind New York state of mind Be having dreams that I'm a gangsta Drinking Moets, holding TEC's Making sure the cash came correct, then I stepped Investments in stocks, sewing up the blocks to sell rocks Winning gunfights with mega-cops But just a nigga walking with his finger on the trigger Make enough figures until my pockets get bigger I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin' Give me a Smith & Wesson, I have niggas undressin' Thinking of cash flow, buddha and shelter Whenever frustrated, I'm a hijack Delta In the PJ's, my blend tape plays, bullets are strays Young bitches is grazed, each block is like a maze Full of black rats trapped plus the Island is packed From what I hear in all the stories When my peoples come back, black I'm living where the nights is jet-black The fiends fight to get crack I just max, I dream I can sit back And lamp like Capone, with drug scripts sewn Or the legal luxury life, rings flooded with stones, holmes I got so many rhymes, I don't think I'm too sane Life is parallel to Hell, but I must maintain And be prosperous, though we live dangerous Cops could just arrest me, blaming us We're held like hostages It's only right that I was born to use mics And the stuff that I write is even tougher than dykes I've taken rappers to a new plateau, through rap slow My rhymin' is a vitamin held without a capsule The smooth criminal on beat breaks Never put me in your box if your shit eats tapes The city never sleeps, full of villains and creeps That's where I learned to do my hustle Had to scuffle with freaks I'm an addict for sneakers 20's of buddha and bitches with beepers In the streets I can greet ya, about blunts I teach ya Inhale deep like the words of my breath I never sleep, cause sleep is the cousin of death I lay puzzle as I backtrack to earlier times Nothing's equivalent to the New York state of mind [Hook] 
Here we are Here we are Yeah This one right here is for the people Sabali, sabali, sabali yonkote Sabali, sabali, sabali kiye Ni kra mg Hey yo D Let's go all the way in on this one Some of the smartest dummies Can't read the language of Egyptian mummies An' a flag on a moon And can't find food for the starving tummies Pay no mind to the youths Cause it's not like the future depends on it But save the animals in the zoo Cause the chimpanzee dem a make big money This is how the media pillages On the TV the picture is Savages in villages And the scientist still can't explain the pyramids Evangelists making a living on the videos of ribs of the little kids Stereotyping the image of the images And this is what the image is You buy a khaki pants And all of a sudden you say a Indiana Jones An' a thief out gold and thief out the scrolls and even the buried bones Some of the worst paparazzis I've ever seen and I ever known Put the worst on display so the world can see And that's all they will ever show So the ones in the West Will never move East And feel like they could be at home Dem get tricked by the beast But a where dem ago flee when the monster is fully grown? Solomonic linage whe dem still can't defeat and them coulda never clone My spiritual DNA that print in my soul and I will forever Own Lord Yeah, Sabali. Thats patience. That's what the old folks told me Discovering the World before this World. A World buried in time Uncover with rhymes. It gets no realer Huh, we born not knowing, are we born knowing all? We growing wiser, are we just growing tall? Can you read thoughts? can you read palms? Huh, can you predict the future? can you see storms, coming? The Earth was flat if you went too far you would fall off Now the Earth is round If the shape change again everybody woulda start laugh The average man can't prove of most of the things That he chooses to speak of And still won't research and find out The root of the truth that you seek of Scholars teach in Universities and claim that they're smart and cunning Tell them find a cure when we sneeze And that's when their nose start running And the rich get stitched up, when we get cut Man a heal dem broken bones in the bush with the wet mud Can you read signs? can you read stars? Can you make peace? can you fight war? Can you milk cows, even though you drive cars? huh Can you survive? Against all odds, now? It's crazy when you feed people the truth you don't know how they're gonna react You're scared of wrong doers, people that just ignorant You're scared of the truth, be patient for now Who wrote the Bible? Who wrote the Qur'an? And was it a lightning storm That gave birth to the Earth And then dinosaurs were born? damn Who made up words? Who made up numbers? And what kind of spell is mankind under? Everything on the planet we preserve and can it Microwaved it and try it No matter what we'll survive it What's hue? What's man? What's human? Anything along the land we consuming Eatin', deletin', ruin Trying to get paper Gotta have land, gotta have acres So I can sit back like Jack Nicholson Watch niggas play the game like the Lakers In a world full of 52 fakers Gypsies, seances, mystical prayers You superstitious? throw salt over your shoulders Make a wish for the day cuz Like somebody got a doll of me Stickin' needles in my arteries But I can't feel it Sometimes it's like 'part of me, but I got a real big spirit' I'm fearless.... I'm fearless Don't you try and grab hold of my soul It's like a military soldier since seven years old I held real dead bodies in my arms Felt their body turn cold, oh Why we born in the first place If this is how we gotta go? Damn This goes to all the wisdom and knowledge seekers of the World Sabali, Patience, yeah

Maybe it's because I kick so much butt I kick ass -- or maybe cause I blast On a stupid-ass nigga when I'm playing with the trigger Of an Uzi or an AK Cause the police always got something stupid to say They put out my picture with silence Cause my identity by itself causes violence The E with the criminal behavior Yeah, I'm a gangsta, but still I got flavor Without a gun and a badge, what do ya got? A sucker in a uniform waiting to get shot By me, or another nigga And with a gat it don't matter if he's smaller or bigger (MC Ren: Size don't mean shit, he's from the old school fool) And as you all know, E's here to rule Whenever I'm rolling, keep looking in the mirror And ears on cue, yo, so I can hear a Dumb motherfucker with a gun And if I'm rolling off the 8, he'll be the one That I take out, and then get away While I'm driving off laughing this is what I'll say Fuck Tha Police Fuck Tha Police Fuck Tha Police Fuck Tha Police The verdict [Dre] The jury has found you guilty of being a redneck White bread, chickenshit motherfucker [Cop] But wait, that's a lie!

[Intro] It's ideal You need someone to tell you how to feel And you think your happiness is real There's so much more the world has to reveal But you choose to be concealed So you're somebody now But what's a somebody in a nobody town I don't think you even know it So you're somebody now But what's a somebody in a nobody town You made enough to quit a couple years ago But it consumes you It's everywhere you go And just the thought alone got you trippin' Got you losing your mind And I don't blame you It's everything you know But I own this time, this ain't new Now I decide when we're through [Hook] I love, you love This love We're professional I know, you know We're sophisticated At loving... [Verse 1] What does it mean When your heart's already numb You're professional Won't treat it like it's personal No, cause it's just love It always makes it's way back around It's dispensable To fall is unacceptable Cause everything you've been through made you stronger And every day you learn about yourself And nothing really played out how it's supposed to Depending on somebody else's wealth But now you know the value of a dollar And girl I make enough of it to spend I love the way you've put yourself together I love the way you make that body bend For me again Oh yeah [Hook] I love, you love This love We're professional I know, you know We're sophisticated At loving...

Now you're thinkin' 'bout it Girl you're thinkin' 'bout it What we got here How we fuckin' got here They recognize They just recognize I'm in a life without a home so this recognition is not enough I don't care about nobody else Cause I've been on these streets way too long, too long, too long Baby I've been on this too long Cause getting faded too long Got me on this rolling stone So I take another hit Kill another serotonin With a hand full of beans And a chest full of weed Got me singing bout a bitch While I'm blowing out my steam And I'mma keep on smoking 'til I can't hit another note Oh but until then I got you Baby I got you Until you're used to my face And my mystery fades I got you So baby love me Before they all love me Until you won't love me Because they'll all love me I'll be different I think I'll be different I hope I'm not different And I hope you'll still listen But until then Baby I got you I got you Girl I still got you I got you 
Where were you when I needed you eight months ago? All your girlfriends talkin' bout me, now you ringin' up my phone I bet you miss me now baby, I bet you'd kiss me now baby Especially since you know that this ain't nothin' and I only just begun You never thought that I would ever go this far You said potential could never last this long Well baby, I've been alone for almost all my life What makes you think that you can ever do me right [Hook] You're the same old song You're the same old song You're the same old song You're the same old song The same old song And now I'm poppin' yea Ain't nobody showed me how I made it big poppin' yeah Tell me how you like me now I swear I loved you girl And you probably went and fucked the world Well you can take another shot everytime you hear me playin' in the club You never thought that I would ever go this far You said potential could never last this long Well baby, I've been alone for almost all my life What makes you think that you can ever do me right [Hook] You're the same old song You're the same old song You're the same old song You're the same old song The same old song [Outro: Juicy J] Listen to that shit, man The Weeknd music make the ladies panties get wet!

Shit I'm still jacking off and proceeding my life careless But getting more pussy cause I tell bitches I'm Wood Harris (as you should) From L.A. to Paris, I'm getting these weird stares At skateparks and airports all in a year, it's weird Yonkers dropped and left them craniums mindfucked Now competition missing like that nigga my mom fucked He still hasn't called me yet (that's not your fault) But that's a whole fucking different argument, shit, I got over it And a couple bucks in my pocket, so now I could go buy A couple hot pockets and grandma could stop cooking Them nasty ass collard greens, pressure's on me like this top hat Bastard intro, how the fuck I'm gonna top that? Tyler, you'll top it, you'll top that, you're a very capable individual Okay, you guys caught me, I'm not a fucking rapist or serial killer, I lied You know, you just want attention, you'll be fine I try too hard, huh?

I'm the star of the group (Yeah) So no one else gets the respect that they deserve cause of you (Bastard was good though) What you think I record it for? To have a bunch a critics call my shit a bunch of horrorcore? Like I didn't make Parade or Inglorious Cause I'm too scared to tell my friends the way I really fucking feel? Of course they only listen to lyrics about me pissin' off In the tombs of Lara Croft, I'm getting pissed off (I bet) Message boards are on my dick, I need a pissing waiver (here) Let me bust one in they mouth, I know they feel the flavor Can't they just be happy for me like, a kid with nothing, living out his dreams? Why they got to fucking hate? I think everyone's happy, everyone's immature, everyone loves you Tyler, you have to believe that I don't even skate anymore, I'm too fucking busy, I can barely kickflip now Why? Why is that? Do you not have any free time at your home? What the fuck you mean I'm not talented? You see the shit that I've been doing? I have, I mean you're a great person I mean, I'm not that great of a rapper but as a whole, I'm pretty cool, right? People excited, thinking shit is so tight Getting co-signs from rappers that I don't even like What the fuck you want me to do? Start to gobble his mic? And start Jackson him off until his cack blasting off? Fuck that, these niggas ain't fucking with me Cause I don't listen to the Immortal of Tech of the nique And all this underground bullshit that's never gon' peak On the Billboard Top 20 and Jam of the Week I'd rather listen to Badu and Pusha the T And some Waka Flocka Flame instead of that real hip hop That's bull of the sheet, but they want to critique Everything that we, Wolf Gang, has ever released But they don't get it, cause it's not made for them The nigga that's in the mirror rapping, it's made for him But they do not have the mindset that's same as him I'm not weird, you're just a faggot, shame on him It is, but Tyler, you're going to have to cut down on that "faggot" word, that's very, that's a bad I'm not homophobic I mean, I don't think you are but... Faggot Alright, well, since the last time we... The fuck is a good performance? I get on stage and I have as much fun as I can I mean, you, you, it seems like you have fun.

[Skit: Seinfeld & Wale] Seinfield: Getting engaged is like getting, uh, it's the first hill of the roller coaster And you hear those clickers, the loud sound - this really violent, metal 'Chunka-chunka-chunka' and you go, "What, what's going on here," You know? "Boy this thing is really, really goes high!" Wale: I'm looking down, 'Oh shit!' Seinfield: And then you go over the top, the wedding is at the top. You go over the top, is the wedding and then you're just screaming Wale: Even if you make plans you never think you're really ready for marriage? Seinfield: No it's uh, it's like any growth. You're no- you can't be ready for it because tha- it's growth, it's gonna be new. It's gonna be new.

Preparing for that day I leave you here and switch you for them It's hard, you know temptation and all Bitches out here tryna see if my relationship's strong Get a place in the charts or runaway from your heart Gave this music my all, nothing is sacred no more - I'm wrong But I'm promisin' you better though And your friends sayin', "let him go" And we ain't gettin' any younger I can give up now, but I can promise you forever though (Realest shit I ever wrote, realest shit I ever wrote Realest shit I ever wrote, if you ever knew love) Ill admit it, let me be hypothetic The day I find a woman I prolly be scared to share it The idea of me finding love, would run somebody off And true my wall could use some plaques, but still I gotta floss Brush you off, see I'm kinda lost Now I'm up in the club with a couple of move ons And dark, good nigga, troubled heart Went from fallin' in love to drunk and fallin' apart This is hard, tryna find some time to move on Cause when we lost our baby, I got shady, shit got too dark Soft, and I thank you baby, you strong My ex before you married too, you solo, I say so long Nah, good terms how that ended But it surely put a dent on how I worry about this business Off white picket fences, on flights with the children On site stealin' kisses on off nights my intentions but But I plan to do it better though But you still sayin' let it go We ain't gettin' any younger Women love me now but in your eyes we forever though We ain't nothin' but some planets Seinfield: I always feel like Im a planet. And these other women that are, kinda moving through this solar system with me. And, marriage is like you decide to jump off of your planet, across to another planet. And you can only do it when one planet passes real close. And you look and you go, Hey, I think I can jump across. 
[Produced by J Gramm Beats] [Intro: Jerry Seinfeld (Elaine Benes)] I guess maybe some little problems could arise (There are always a few) If anything happened and we couldn't be friends the way we are now, that would really be bad (Devastating) Because this is very good (And that would be good) That would be good too, the idea is to combine this and that Tryna keep it low Keep 'em on that need to know Tell everybody that we're just friends But to be honest that platonic shit's for TV shows Same place, we're with different folks Case closed if they crack the code Is it me, or is you cold? Cause the feelings you ain't showin' pokin' out your clothes Go put a sweater on or get a room Forbidden fruit, swimmin' in your juice Lot of ways I can get to you But my train of thought is tryna get you out your ch-ch-choo Still we keep it low Keep 'em all on that need to know Could somebody tell somebody I'm somebody and I'm sorry but somebody gon' need to go [Hook: SZA] I'm not tryna pressure you Just can't stop thinkin' 'bout you You ain't even really gotta be my boyfriend I just wanna know your name And maybe some time, we can hook up We can hang out, we can just chill Tryna keep it low Keep 'em all on that need to know Tell 'em all that we're just cool As far as me and you, we got a simple code Spendin' nights, well that's optional No telephones in the afternoon I know that overthinkin' only leads to subtweetin' Every time your ass in the mood Sharin' thoughts when we share a room Though we barely talk when we share a room In the dark, still see your curves Body like what, swear to God you're a miracle Still we keep it low Keep 'em all on that need to know Could somebody tell somebody I'm somebody and I'm sorry but somebody gon' need to go [Hook: SZA] I'm not tryna pressure you Just can't stop thinkin' 'bout you You ain't even really gotta be my boyfriend I just wanna know your name And maybe some time, we can hook up We can hang out, we can just chill [Interlude: Jerry Seinfeld (Elaine Benes)] I mean let's say, what if we did? (What if?) Is that like the end of the world or something? (Certainly not!) Why shouldn't we be able to do that once in a while if we want to? (I know!) I mean really, what is the big deal? We go in there, we're in there for a while and then we come back out here. It's not complicated (It's almost stupid if we didn't!) It's moronic (Absurd!) [Hook: SZA] I'm not tryna pressure you Just can't stop thinkin' 'bout you You ain't even really gotta be my boyfriend I just wanna know your name And maybe some time, we can hook up We can hang out, we can just chill
